 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colloquia are usually held during the Common Hour time slot or in the late afternoon.  Topics include classical nuggets that do not fit into the standard courses, special little problems that have the fancy of the speaker, an overview of some new development, information about graduate schools, applications from government or industry, a report on an honors project, and so on.  Other events are held to promote life outside the classroom for the majors.  Annual picnics are held in the winter and spring to bring the professors and students together.
