      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some who would maintain that since
computer science relies on the use of machinery, it belongs more to the engineering discipline and has no place in the curriculum of a liberal arts college.  
      The arguments supporting this point of view are akin to those made by the sledge pullers who claimed that the wheel demeaned the "dignity of honest labor".  
      What makes computer science a liberal discipline is not the machinery, but the process by which algorithms and data structures are devised to facilitate the use of the machinery in the solution of the problems.  
      It is this process that embodies the elements of a liberal education.  There can be no doubt that it involves logical, precise thinking.  
      It is a subject matter that relies on the major landmarks of human achievement that have clearly shaped our present and will have an increasing role in shaping our future.  
      It is carefully structured discipline that relies on its
interactions with other disciplines for its very life blood.  Computer
Science has made contributions that have changed the way other disciplines regard 
      themselves and conduct their inquiries, and is has drawn on many
other disciplines for making advances in its own base of information.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our view of computer science at Gettysburg College is that it is a study of the solutions of problems through the use of algorithms and data structures and the implementation of these solutions on computing machinery.  
      To the extent that we study the computing machine itself, it is a
study of the logical design of the machine and the higher order problems
associated with having the machine operate in a problem solving environment.  
      In short, we have clearly chosen to emphasize the algorithmic side of the computer science discipline.  This side embodies the liberal arts tradition of Gettysburg College.
