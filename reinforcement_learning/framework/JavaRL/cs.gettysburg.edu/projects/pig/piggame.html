<p>The game of Pig is a very simple jeopardy dice game in which two
players race to reach 100 points.  Each turn, a player repeatedly
rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores
the sum of the rolls (i.e. the <i>turn total</i>).  At any time during
a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:
<ul>
<li> <b>roll</b> - If the player rolls a 
<ul>
<li> <b>1</b>: the player scores nothing and it becomes
the opponent's turn.
<li> <b>2 - 6</b>: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.
</ul></li>
<li> <b>hold</b> - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn. </li>
</ul>

<p>The key decision facing a player is how large a turn total should
be risked to possibly get an even larger total.  To learn more about
