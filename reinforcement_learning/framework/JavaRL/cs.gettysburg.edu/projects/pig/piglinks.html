variation of Pig where a roll of 1 scores one point.  In this acyclic
variation, you can't find yourself in the same situation twice.  Such
a game can be solved with dynamic programming (computing the best
moves from the end of the game backwards to the beginning).  This Pig

partial analysis of two dice Pig.</a> - A hold value analysis is
performed assuming one is trying to reach 100 in <i>N</i> turns.
However, the analysis doesn't provide a policy for what N should be.
"In practice (in a game) you as a player have to determine how many
turns you should use to try to get to 100."  This analysis is more
complex than Knizia's odds-based analysis.  Although there are regions
in our Pig state space where the optimal player is clearly trying to
reach the goal in one or two turns, the true optimal policy is more
complex than "win in <i>N</i> turns" over much of the state space.  We
conjecture that the solution for this version of Pig would be
qualitatively similar to our own, and thus more complex than this
analysis indicates.
