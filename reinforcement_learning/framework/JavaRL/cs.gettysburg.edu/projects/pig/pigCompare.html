<p>Below are solutions of several Pig variants.  In each
visualization, the surfaces shown represent the boundaries between
situations in which one should roll or hold.  The axes are your score
(Player 1), the opponent's score, and your current turn total.  In the
VRML links, the solution to each variant is shown in blue, with the
original Pig solution shown in semi-transparent white.</p>

<p>For all variants, we have made the uniform assumption that the
first player to 100 points wins.  Some variants actually have slightly
different winning conditions, e.g. allowing all players to have the
same number of turns.  For detailed variant descriptions and technical
details of these solutions, see

<TD><p><B>Pig Dice&reg;</B> (&copy; 1942 Parker Prothers) is a 2-dice
variant of Pig that has had surprisingly little influence on the rules
of modern variants.  This is in part due to the fact that the game
requires specialized dice.  One die is a standard die with a pig head
replacing the 1.  The other is a standard die with a pig tail
replacing the 6.  Such rolls are called Heads and Tails, respectively.
</p>

<p>As before, players may hold or roll, risking accumulated turn totals.
However, there is no undesirable single die value in this game.
Rather, rolling dice that <i>total 7</i> ends the turn without scoring.
Rolling a Head and a Tail doubles the current turn total.  Rolling
just a Head causes the value of the other die to be doubled.  Rolling
just a Tail causes the value of the other die to be negated.  The turn
total can never be negative.  If a negated die would cause a negative
turn total, the turn total is set to 0.  All other non-7 roll totals
are added to the turn total.</p>

<TD><p><b>2-Dice Pig</b> - According to game analyst Bill Butler, one
of the simplest and most common variants, which we will call <i>2-dice
Pig</i>, was produced commercially under the name "Pig" around the
1950's.  The rules are the same as our 1-die Pig except:

<ul>
<li>Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is
added to the turn total.</li>
<li>If a single 1 is rolled, the player's turn ends with the loss of the
turn total.</li>
<li>If two 1's are rolled, the player's turn ends with the loss of
the turn total <i>and score</i>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Skunk&reg;</b> (&copy; 1953
W.H. Schaper Manufacturing Co.) is a commercial variant which
elaborates on this with a chip penalty system.

<TD><b>Frey's Pig</b> - In his book "How to Win at Dice Games", Skip
Frey describes a 2-dice Pig variation that
differs only in how doubles are treated.
<ul>
<li>If two 1's are rolled, the player adds 25 to the turn total and
it becomes the opponent's turn.</li> 
<li>If other double numbers are rolled, the player adds twice
the value of the dice to the turn total, and the player's turn
continues.</li>

<TD><b>Big Pig</b> - In his book "Dice Games Properly Explained",
Reiner Knizia describes this variant, which is identical to Frey's pig
except that the player's turn continues after scoring 25 from a
double-1 roll.

<TD><b>Pass the Pigs&reg; (&copy; 1995 David Moffat Enterprises and
Hasbro, Inc.)</b> - A popular commercial variant, Pass the Pigs was
designed by David Moffat in 1977 as PigMania&reg; (&copy; 1977 David
Moffat Enterprises).  In this variant, small rubber pigs are used as
dice.  When rolled, each pig can come to rest in a variety of
positions with varying probability: on its right side, on its left
side, upside down ("razorback"), upright ("trotter"),
balanced on the snout and front legs ("snouter"), and balanced
on the snout, left leg, and left ear ("leaning jowler").  This
approximate solution is derived from the pig dice roll data given <a
href="http://members.tripod.com/~passpigs/prob.html">here</a>.  (We
assume the probability for an "oinker", two pigs leaning on one
another, is 0, since such data is not given and the dice can be thrown
such that this is an exceedingly rare event.)  The combined positions
of the two pigs lead to various scores.</b>

<p>Pass the Pigs is similar to 2-dice Pig, in that a roll of left side and
right side has the same consequences as rolling a 1 (i.e., the turn
ends with the loss of the turn total), and a roll with pigs touching
has the same consequences as rolling two 1's (i.e., the turn ends with
the loss of the turn total and score).  Pass the Pigs is similar to Frey's
variant in that two pigs in the same non-side configuration score
double what they would individually.</p>

<TD><b>Piggy</b> - In the May/June 2000 issue of Muse Magazine, Ivars
Peterson describes Piggy, which varies from 2-dice Pig in that there
is no bad dice value.  However, doubles have the same consequences as
a single 1 in 2-dice Pig.  </TD>

    <TD><b>Hog</b> - Hog is best described as Pig where one must
    commit to a number of dice rolls at the beginning of the turn.  In
    each turn of Hog, one chooses any number of dice and rolls them
    all at once. (The optimal player will need at most 26 dice.) The
    sum of the dice is scored if and only if no 1's are rolled.  While
    technically not a jeopardy dice game, Hog is nonetheless strongly
    related to Pig, as can be seen by comparing the optimal number of
    dice to roll versus the shape of Pig's roll/hold boundary.
