<h3>
Course Overview</h3>
Data mining describes a diverse area of research where techniques from machine 
learning, statistics, and information theory are synthesized to classify, 
cluster, interpolate, or associate large bodies of data.&nbsp; The practitioner 
can &quot;mine&quot; such data for patterns or rules that facilitate greater understanding 
of the data and/or facilitate intelligent response to new data.&nbsp; In this 
course, there are several learning objectives:<ul>
	<li>Understand of input/output for several data mining 
	techniques:
		<ul>
		<li> classification - 1R, Na<font face="Times New Roman">ï</font>ve Bayes, top-down decision tree induction, PRISM</li>
		<li> association</li>
		<li> numeric prediction - linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li>Experience such techniques through application of the
	<a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/index.html">WEKA</a> (&quot;Waikato 
	Environment for Knowledge Analysis&quot;) software workbench and/or 
	implementation.</li>
	<li>Gain critical skills for performance evaluation of such techniques and 
	consideration of their ethical application </li>

</ul>

<h3>
Grading</h3>
70% Assignments
<br>10% Quizzes/Exams
<br>20% Class Attendance/Participation
<p>You are responsible to know the material from each lecture and reading
assignment before the start of the next class.&nbsp; Homework is due <b>at
the beginning of lecture on the due date.</b>&nbsp; Late homework will not 
necessarily be accepted.<b>&nbsp; </b>Code must be a legal program in the 
relevant language in order to be graded.&nbsp; (It need not be free from logic 
errors.)&nbsp; For compiled languages, this means that the program must compile 
without error.&nbsp; For interpreted languages, this means it must be 
interpretable without error.&nbsp; Class attendance
and participation is required.&nbsp; If you attend all classes and are
willing to participate, you'll get 100% for this part of your grade.&nbsp;
Even if you know enough to give a particular lecture, please consider the
value of helping your peers during in-class exercises
<h3>
Honor Code</h3>
 Honesty, Integrity, Honor.&nbsp; These are more important than anything we
will teach in this class.&nbsp; Students can and are encouraged to help each
other understand course concepts, but all graded work must be done independently.
The work you submit (including both code and problem solving ideas expressed
in the code) should be your independent work.&nbsp; For detailed information
about the honor code, see
