<br><b>Due Friday 1/29 at 4PM</b><p><b>Note: </b>This work is to be done in <b>

their partner's work upon request.&nbsp; 
<h1>Square Peg Solitaire Puzzle</h1>
<p>Given:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Initial state: A 4-by-4 grid filled with pegs except for one initial 
	empty grid position</li>
	<li>Actions: Horizontal and vertical jump removals of pegs.&nbsp; If a peg 
	may jump over a single orthogonally (i.e. horizontally or vertically) 
	adjacent peg into an empty space beyond, the peg jumped over is removed.</li>
	<li>Goal state: Any 4-by-4 grid with a single peg remaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Which empty grid positions will yield an initial state that is solvable?&nbsp; 
	That is, for which initial states can we find a sequence of actions (jumps) 
	leading to a goal state?</li>
</ul>
<p>Deliverable:</p>
<ul>
	<li>README file containing<ul>
		<li>Honor Pledge, student names, and respective ID numbers</li>
		<li>Description of submitted files along with instructions for how they 
		would be used to answer the above question</li>
		<li>The answer to the question above</li>

	<li>All Java files necessary to demonstrate the answer to the above question</li>
	<li>An emailed .zip file containing the above items</li>
	<li>An in-person demonstration of the above software before the due date.&nbsp;
