<p><b><u>Programming Assignment</u></b>
<p><b><u>HW6</u></b></p>
<p>Due Friday 3/7 at the beginning of class.&nbsp; If your work is completed and
checked by me before I leave on Thursday afternoon, attendance at Friday's class
is optional.&nbsp; You must work
in pairs on this homework.&nbsp; An improvised, informal
presentation of your work may be requested in a later class.</p>
<p>Implement and test the Sarsa algorithm (Fig. 6.9) for the Windy Gridworld
with King's Moves (Exercise 6.6).&nbsp;&nbsp; For output, you should print the
e-soft policy you're using (e.g. e-greedy) and the parameters (e.g. epsilon =
.01).&nbsp; At intervals (e.g. after every <i>n</i> trials) print the current
iteration, <i>greedy </i>policy, and corresponding <i>greedy</i> evaluations of
states.&nbsp; Represent the policy in a tabular layout in the same orientation
as Gridworld locations with -- = stay, N = North, S = South, E = East, W = West,
NE = Northeast, etc.&nbsp; Represent the state values in a tabular layout
showing significant digits such that the tabular layout is less than 80
columns.&nbsp; Do the same with and without the &quot;stay&quot; move.&nbsp;
What is the length of each of the optimal paths?&nbsp; (The optimal policy with
the four directions has a cost of 15.)</p>
<p>Every action (including staying or moving to the goal state) has a reward of
-1.&nbsp; The world does not wrap around.&nbsp; You can make differing
assumptions about the way the world evolves at the boundaries, but <i>you must
be explicit about your assumptions.</i>&nbsp; For example, here are two <i>different
</i>assumption
sets:</p>
<p>(1) All moves are legal in all states.&nbsp; To compute the resulting state,
change the (x,y) position according to the move and the wind.&nbsp; The move
and/or the wind may take the agent temporarily off the grid, but the final
resulting position is the <i>closest grid point.&nbsp; </i>Example:&nbsp; You're
in the top (northmost) row in a column with wind +2 (northward).&nbsp; You move
northeast.&nbsp; This takes you 1 space to the east and three spaces northward,
but the resulting position is directly to the east, because that's the closest
point on the grid to the initial result of your movement.</p>
<p>(2) It is illegal to perform a move that would take the agent off the grid if
there were no wind.&nbsp; The move is resolved before the wind blows.&nbsp;
Example: You're in the bottom (southmost) row in a column with wind +1
(northward).&nbsp; You cannot move southeast and end up directly to the east,
because this would take you off the board in the first phase of movement. </p>
