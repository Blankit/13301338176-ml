<b><u>Discussion Questions</u></b>
<p>What is reinforcement learning (RL)?
<br>What is supervised learning and how is it different from RL?
<br>What is the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and why is it important?
<br>What are examples of reinforcement learning applications?&nbsp; (See
also the case studies of Ch. 11)
<br>Imagine and describe a potential reinforcement learning application
not mentioned in chapter 1 or 11.
<br>What are the four main parts of a RL system?
<br>What is a policy?&nbsp; What kind of policy does a RL agent seek to
learn?
<br>What is a reward function?&nbsp; What would be the biological analogue?
<br>What is a value function?&nbsp; How does it differ from the reward
function?&nbsp; How are they related?
<br>What is a model?&nbsp; How do planning techniques use models differently?
<br>Describe the Tic-Tac-Toe example in terms of these parts.
<br>What is a greedy policy?&nbsp; Why can a RL agent learn suboptimal
behavior with a greedy policy?
<br>Write and explain the Tic-Tac-Toe example value function update.&nbsp;
Rewrite the update with the right-hand side having only a single V(s) term.&nbsp;
What is the parameter alpha, what values can alpha have, and how does it
affect learning?
<br>Why is this a temporal-difference learning method?
<br>RL is not limited to Tic-Tac-Toe.&nbsp; In what respects is it more
generally applicable?
<p><b>Optional:</b>
<br>Overview the history of reinforcement learning, describing the three
main threads and the most important and influential works.
<br>Discuss possible RL project ideas for later this semester.
<p><b><u>Programming Assignment</u></b>
<p>None. (See reading above.)
