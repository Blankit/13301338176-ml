Proposal</u></b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Write
a proposal for a reinforcement learning project that can be completed with 3
weeks of programming.&nbsp; Your description of the problem should be complete
and unambiguous.&nbsp; Use the text example and exercise descriptions as a model
for your problem description.&nbsp; Then describe your goal and the technique(s)
you plan to apply towards the achievement of this goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><b>Keep
it simple!...&nbsp; </b>If you find your project too simple, you can always look
to more difficult problems.&nbsp; It's much more frustrating to bite off more
than you can chew and not complete it successfully.&nbsp; My advice is to pick a
challenge problem that interests you (e.g. poker, magnetic levitation control,
lego robotics, etc.), and <i>boil the problem down to its essential
characteristics.</i>&nbsp; Remove constraints, make simplifying assumptions, and
do everything you can to reduce the size of the state space without changing the
nature of the problem.&nbsp; For example, Piglet is a much simpler dice game
than Farkle (a.k.a. Ten Thousand), but they're both very similar jeopardy games
at heart.&nbsp; Piglet (if it weren't already done as an assignment) would make
a much better goal than Farkle for this assignment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">...
<b>but not too simple.</b>&nbsp; Your problem should be an associative task,
preferably one with a possibility of repeated states within a single
trial.&nbsp; The n-armed bandit would not be a good choice of problem unless (in
an exceptional case) one wanted to do fundamental research on various update
rules as we did in Chapter 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Making
wise choices up front is perhaps the most important step for a successful
project.&nbsp; Give this good, sustained thought, and feel free to stop by to
discuss the merits of various ideas you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><b><u> Problem statement draft</u></b></p>
<p>Your problem statement draft should be a complete specification of the
machine learning problem you are addressing.&nbsp; That is, you should <i>fully
specify</i> the states, actions, and rewards of your ML system.&nbsp; If you're
using a function approximator, you should give full specifications of your
planned use.&nbsp; For instance, if you're using an artificial neural network,
completely specify the input units, # of hidden units, and output unit(s).&nbsp;
These specifications are non-binding; you may adjust them if you find other
specifications are more sensible.&nbsp; At this stage, you need to be
implementing and thinking in terms of the implementation details.</p>
<p><b><u> Total system complete</u></b></p>
<p>Submit your work using &quot;submit cs391 proj1&quot;.&nbsp; You should have
a completely implemented system.&nbsp; Unless I've said otherwise in reviewing
your proposal, your agent need not make smart decision.&nbsp; You should be
able, however, to demonstrate that the entire simulation is fully
functional.&nbsp; Thus, your states, actions, rewards, environment, agent, and
simulation needs to be completely and correctly implemented.&nbsp; Be prepared
to give a brief, informal demonstration.</p>
<p><u><b> Project milestone complete</b></u></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">At this point, you should be able to show some evidence
    of simple learning.&nbsp; Pick an easily achievable milestone.&nbsp; Having
    achieved it, you can build on it in the coming week.&nbsp; In the worst
    case, the following week can be used to achieve a modest success. Submit
    your work using &quot;submit cs391 proj2&quot;.&nbsp;
    <p class="MsoNormal"><u><b> Project complete</b></u>
    <p class="MsoNormal">All project work and associated documentation should be
    complete at this point.&nbsp; Your code should be clearly commented, and
    your README file should indicate how to operate your program and collect
    your data.&nbsp; Submit your work using &quot;submit cs391 proj3&quot;.
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Abstract</u></b>
    <p class="MsoNormal">For our symposium, we'll have a handout with all names,
    titles, and abstracts for presentations.&nbsp; E-mail this information
    directly to me.&nbsp; An abstract is a 1-2 paragraph summary of what you'll
    be presenting.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Project presentation</u></b>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Plan to briefly present (1) a clear, concise problem
    description, (2) a high-level description of the technique(s) you applied
    the problem (names and their general characteristics; no algorithms), and
    (3) the results you observed (e.g. graph(s), demo).&nbsp; You'll have ~5
    minutes, but do your best to plan for 4.&nbsp; We'd like to leave time for
    one audience question after each overview.
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Complete paper draft</u></b>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Submit (hardcopy or e-mail) a complete draft of your
    paper for review on 4/30.&nbsp; Plan to stop by my office on 4/30 or 5/1
    before 4PM to go over my comment.&nbsp; The main purpose of this review is
    to ensure that your content in complete.&nbsp; That is, I want to ensure
    that all information is included that is necessary to reproduce your
    results.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, people often forget to include important
    parameters such as learning rates or reward discount rates.
    <p class="MsoNormal">Here's a suggested structure for your final paper:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Title and Abstract (1-2 paragraph summary)</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Introduction: brief overview of paper, roadmap to paper structure</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Problem Definition: complete description of problem (e.g. agent,<br>
    environment, states, actions, rewards)</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Experimentation: complete description of techniques applied (no Java<br>
    specifics; talk in terms of algorithms and information)</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Results: presentation and interpretation of what you learned from<br>
    the experimentation</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Conclusions: summary of what was accomplished; suggestions for<br>
    future work</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal">References&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

making sure you have all the necessary content, polish your paper's
presentation.&nbsp; Your code, it's documentation, and this paper will serve as
a resource to future students of this material.&nbsp; Future projects may seek
to build on your results.&nbsp; Please make sure you do a quality, professional
job of informing the reader of your work.</span></p>
