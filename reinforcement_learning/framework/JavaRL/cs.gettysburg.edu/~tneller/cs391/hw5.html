<br><b>Due the beginning of class </b>on Thursday 2/25.<p><b>Note: </b>This work is to be done in <b>groups of 2</b>.&nbsp; Each group will submit one assignment.&nbsp; Although 
you may divide the work, both team members should be able to present/describe 
their partner's work upon request.&nbsp; 
<h1>Upper Section Yahtzee</h1>
<p>First:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Learn to play
	<a href="http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Yahtzee.pdf">Yahtzee</a></li>
	<li>Play Yahtzee. I can loan you dice if needed. Scoring sheets and other 
	resources can be found at
	<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2243/yahtzee">BoardGameGeek.com</a>.&nbsp; 
	Opportunities to
	<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?q=play+yahtzee+online">play online</a> 
	abound.</li>
	<li>Then read &quot;<a href="http://www.cs.loyola.edu/~jglenn/research/optimal_yahtzee.pdf">An 
	Optimal Strategy for Yahtzee</a>&quot; by James Glenn.&nbsp; Seriously, read it.&nbsp; 
	If not, you will misunderstand widgets and incorrectly answer the central 
	question of this homework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now consider a simplified form of Yahtzee consisting of only the 6 upper 
section categories (&quot;ones&quot; through &quot;sixes&quot;) and the upper section bonus of 35 
for a total of 63 or more.&nbsp; Let us call this minigame &quot;Upper Section 
Yahtzee&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We will approach the computation of optimal Upper Section Yahtzee play in 
stages.&nbsp; In the first stage, you will count and construct the reachable 
Glenn-style &quot;widgets&quot; of play for all possible starts of turns.&nbsp; You need
<em>not</em> at this stage fully implement the widgets for solving.&nbsp; It 
will be useful to store the widgets in such a way that will make it easy to 
retrieve them for retrograde analysis, i.e. solving turn-by-turn in stages from 
the last turn back to the beginning.</p>
<p>You will submit your code as a .zip file in an email that mentions the
<strong>number of widgets generated</strong> for Upper Section Yahtzee.</p>
