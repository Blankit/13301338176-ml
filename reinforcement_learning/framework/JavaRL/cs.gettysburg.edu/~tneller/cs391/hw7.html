<br><b>Due the beginning of class </b>on Thursday 3/17<p><b>Note: </b>This work is to be done in <b>groups of 2</b>.&nbsp; Each group will submit one assignment.&nbsp; Although 
you may divide the work, both team members should be able to present/describe 
their partner's work upon request.&nbsp; 
<h1><font size=+2>Optimal Solitaire Upper Section Yahtzee</font></h1>
<p>Implement <a href="yahtzee/doc7/YahtzeeSolver.html">YahtzeeSolver.java</a> according to these
<a href="yahtzee/doc7/index.html">specifications</a> in order to optimize 
solitaire score.&nbsp; You will be given 
starter code for YahtzeeSolver via 
email.&nbsp; The correct output to the test main methods provided is given
<a href="yahtzee/testOutput/OptimalUpperSectionYahtzee.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>Outline of computation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For each turn from the last to the first:<ul>
		<li>For each widget of that turn:<ul>
			<li>Compute optimal play and score expectation after the second 
			reroll:<ul>
				<li>For each roll:<ul>
					<li>For each unscored scoring category,
					<ul>
						<li>Compute the immediate score for the roll</li>
						<li>Compute the future expected score (either from the 
						widget that would follow, or the value of 35 or 0 at 
						game end depending on whether the bonus was achieved or 
						not)</li>
						<li>Compute total expected future score by adding the 
						immediate score increase and future score expectations.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Record the scoring category and total expected future 
					score where the latter is maximized.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Compute optimal play and score expectation after the first 
			reroll:<ul>
				<li>For each roll:<ul>
					<li>Compute the best immediate scoring category just as 
					after the second reroll.</li>
					<li>Additionally, for each possible reroll:<ul>
						<li>Compute the probability of the reroll</li>
						<li>Compute the resulting roll</li>
						<li>Look up the corresponding score expectation</li>
						<li>Add the probability times the score expectation to 
						the total expected score for the reroll action</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Record the reroll or immediate scoring action that 
					yields the maximum expected future score.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Compute optimal play and score expectation after the first roll 
			just as in the previous step.</li>
			<li>Compute the widget score expectation as the expected future 
			score of <em>any</em> roll where one rerolls all dice (to simulate 
			the first roll of all dice at the beginning of the turn). This is 
			much like an inner loop of the previous steps.</li>
			<li>Store the widget expected future score for use in the 
			computation of preceding widgets.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that returning the optimal play and score from the <code>getOptimalActionAndScore</code>
method then simply amounts to selecting the current 
relevant widget and recomputing optimal play for that widget until the optimal 
play has been computed and then simply return it.</p>
<p>Take special care to encode plays as specified.</p>
