<h1>FreeCellNode</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Create a search node implementation for FreeCell that makes use of the 
	supplied Card and Shuffle classes to allow the initialization and play of 
	any Microsoft Freecell shuffle.</li>
	<li>Specifications for children expansion:<ul class="style2">
		<li>When printing solutions, follow the
		<a href="http://freecellgamesolutions.com/notation.html">notation of the 
		FreeCell solutions site</a>.</li>
		<li>Allow

		supermoves</a>.</li>
		<li>Implement safe autoplay to the foundation initially (upon 
		construction) and after each play according to NetCELL's safe autoplay 
		rules. From the <a href="http://www.solitairelaboratory.com/fcfaq.html">
		FreeCell FAQ</a>:<ul>
			<li>
						A deal where all of the cards go home at the start is easy to 
			construct, but it is fantastically unlikely for such a deal to occur 
			at random, since Microsoft FreeCell or FreeCell Pro only plays an 
			available card to its homecell automatically when all of the 
			lower-ranked cards of the opposite color are already on the 
			homecells (except that a two is played if the corresponding ace is 
			on its homecell); aces are always played when available. This is one 
			version of what can be called&nbsp;<strong>safe 
			autoplay</strong>. 
			NetCELL uses a more aggressive rule, making all of the plays that MS 
			FreeCell makes, but also playing an available card if both homecells 
			of the opposite color are within two ranks of that card and the 
			homecell of the same color and opposite suit is within three ranks. 
			For example, in NetCELL 28865-5, the four of diamonds is played as 
			soon as the three of diamonds, both black twos, and the ace of 
			hearts are on the homecells. The reason for this is that the four of 
			diamonds is not needed on the tableau to hold either black three, 
			since both can go to their homecells as soon as they are available, 
			and the black threes are not needed to hold the two of hearts, since 
			it can also go to its homecell as soon as it is available. (NetCELL 
			plays as many cards as possible under this rule as soon as the cards 
			are dealt; MS FC and FCPro don't do anything until the player moves 
			the first card).</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If there is more than one free 
		cell, play to the leftmost cell only.</li>
		<li>If there is more than one empty cascade, play to the 
		leftmost empty cascade only.&nbsp;
		<strong>It appears that the convention for a supermove to 
		an empty column is to move as many cards as possible.</strong> &#8220;All moves to 
		empty columns are column moves rather than single card moves.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.solitairelaboratory.com/solutioncatalog.html">http://www.solitairelaboratory.com/solutioncatalog.html</a>)
		&nbsp;Presumably this does not disallow 
		solutions because any solution that requires a lesser card movement 
		could be replicated through other legal moves (e.g. single card moves in 
		the worst case).&nbsp; Thus a 
		column move &#8220;ij&#8221; where j is empty is presumed to be a maximal movement 
		of cards from i to j.
		</li>
		<li>It will be advantageous to override the hashcode method 
	for your node to create an int key to help with repeated state checking.&nbsp; 
	One way to do this is to define a toString method (highly recommended) and 
	have hashcode return toString().hashcode().&nbsp; Collisions are possible, 
	... but are they probable?</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For different powers of 10 (until either out of default 
	Java memory or exceeding 2 minutes), generate and store that many random 
	FreeCell nodes and record the time and max size of the process.
	<ul>
		<li>Call System.currentTimeMillis() before and after the 
		generation of nodes and compute the difference.&nbsp; Report results in 
		milliseconds.</li>
		<li>Store generated nodes in an ArrayList.</li>
		<li>Generate nodes as follows: Generate a random seed in 
		the range 1-1,000,000 and use it to create an initial shuffle with that 
		seed. Create and store the root node.&nbsp; While the node expansion 
		generates children, pick a random child, store it, and repeat for its 
		children.&nbsp; Do this for a maximum of 50 iterations or until there 
		are no moves, then repeat with a new random seed until the desired 
		number of nodes have been generated.</li>
		<li><a href="examples/freecell/FreeCellNodeTest.java">Sample testing 
		code</a></li>
		<li>Plot the growth in time and space (e.g. using a 
		spreadsheet program) using reasonable scales (e.g. log-log, semi-log, 
		etc.).</li>
