<h3>
Course Overview</h3>
A most fascinating research field, I like to describe Artificial Intelligence
(AI) as the interesting "miscellaneous pile" of computer science.&nbsp;
For example, more expressive, computationally-complex database research
finds its home in AI as "knowledge representation and reasoning".&nbsp;
The difficult inverse of computer graphics is machine vision.&nbsp; Where do you
think the object-oriented paradigm reached its maturity?&nbsp; Many interesting,
cutting-edge problems and developments find their birthplace and first
home in this ambitious and visionary research community.
<p>Presented with the unifying theme of constructing intelligent software
agents, we survey an interesting variety of research problems and modern
problem solving techniques.&nbsp; Topics we cover may include search,
game-tree search, stochastic local search, constraint satisfaction, knowledge representation and
reasoning, reasoning under uncertainty,&nbsp;data mining, robotics, and philosophical
foundations.
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Understand the role of AI in the context of Computer Science, and how 
	the diverse problem solving techniques can be unified in terms of agents and 
	optimization.</li>
	<li>Experientially learn several AI problem solving techniques through pair 
	programming work on challenge problems.</li>
	<li>Grow in the ability to observe complex problems, model them simply and 
	formally through abstraction and approximation, and apply programming skill 
	to create &quot;intelligent&quot; software artifacts. </li>
	</ul>

<br>Office: Glatfelter 209
<br>

Office Hours: Mo-Fr 2-4PM or by appointment. Note:&nbsp;Generally,
feel free to drop in if my office door is open (i.e., most of the time
beyond class).<br>Phone: 337-6643

<h3>
Grading</h3>
60% Assignments <br>10% Quizzes / Exams <br>20% 4th Hour Requirements<br>5% 
Colloquium Attendance<br>5% Class 
Attendance / Participation <p>You are responsible to know the material 
from each lecture and reading assignment before the start of the next class.&nbsp; 
Homework is due <b>at the beginning of lecture on the due date.</b>&nbsp; Late 
homework will not necessarily be accepted.<b>&nbsp; </b>Code must be a legal program 
in the relevant language in order to be graded.&nbsp; (It need not be free from logic 
errors.)&nbsp; </p>
<p>You are required to <strong>attend 2 colloquia</strong> or approved 
departmental events over the course of the semester.</p>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Class attendance and participation is
required.&nbsp; If you attend all classes and are willing to
participate, you'll get 100% for this part of your grade.&nbsp; Even if
you know enough to give a particular lecture, please consider the value
of helping your peers
during in-class exercises. </p>
<p>Woody Allen is quoted as saying
<a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/06/10/showing-up/">&quot;80% of success is 
just showing up.&quot;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; While our class attendance/participation grade 
is not 80% of the final grade, it is critical that late arrivals and unexcused 
absences are not excessive.&nbsp; Missing more than half of class unexcused is 
considered being absent.&nbsp; An unexcused late arrival is counted as a half 
absence.&nbsp; <strong>If the total number of absences counted this way exceeds 
20% of class meetings, i.e. 6 absences or more, the student will have failed the 
course.</strong></p>
<h3>Work Expectations</h3>
<p> You are expected to <strong>work an average of 9 hours per week beyond class 
time</strong>.&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.gettysburg.edu/faculty/documents/2014/GettysburCollege2014AcademicCourseCreditPolicyandDeclarationForm.pdf">
Gettysburg College policy</a>, in accordance with federal and state standards, 
equates 1 credit unit with an average of 12 hours of work per week with 50 
minute classes counting as 1 full hour of work.&nbsp; During these remaining 9 
hours beyond class, a student is expected to learn from assigned readings, 
complete exercises related to such readings, attend required colloquia, and 
complete assignments.</p>
<p> Think of your college studies as a more-than-full-time job, and engage in it 
with passion.&nbsp; After all, you get out of it what you put into it, and it is 
my hope that you'll gain much from your investment in this course.&nbsp; If 
you'd like to learn more about how to better track tasks and manage time as a 
student, consider watching <a href="../resources/gtd/summary.html">my short 
tutorial on getting things done</a>.</p>
<h3>
Honor Code</h3>
Honesty, Integrity, Honor.&nbsp; These are more important than anything
we will teach in this class.&nbsp; Students can and are encouraged to help
each other understand course concepts, but all graded work must be done
independently unless otherwise specified (e.g. group work).&nbsp; Submitted work 
should be created by those submitting it.&nbsp; Submission 
of plagiarized code or design work is a violation of the Honor Code, which I 
strictly enforce.&nbsp; For
detailed information about the Honor Code, see
<a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot">
http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot</a>.
<p>What is permitted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Discussing algorithms, syntax, and problem specifications with other 
	students</li>
	<li>Seeking assistance (as needed) from CS professors, students assistants, 
	and approved tutors</li>
	<li>Use of &quot;starter code&quot; supplied by your professor, or code you have 
	previously developed</li>
</ul>
<p>What is not permitted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sharing code: Verbal dictation of code, transference of code (e.g. 
	e-mail, file transfer, entry of printed output, etc.).&nbsp; An important 
	component of this experiential learning process is developing the ability to 
	independently devise algorithms and express them in program code.</li>
	<li>Viewing and/or using unauthorized code (e.g. solutions found online, 
	downloads from code repositories, etc.)</li>
	<li>Submitting work that implicitly takes credit for work that should be 
	credited to others</li>
	<li>Efforts to obscure the source of unauthorized work</li>
	<li>Outsourcing work</li>
</ul>
<p>Put simply, students may discuss assignments at an abstract level (e.g. 
specifications, algorithm pseudocode), but must actually implement solutions 
independently or in permitted groups.&nbsp; Credit should be given where credit 
is due.&nbsp; Let your conscience be your guide.&nbsp; Do not merely focus on 
the result; learn from the process.</p>
