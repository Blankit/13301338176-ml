<h2>
Mobile Robotics Monte Carlo Localization Challenge</h2>
In the summer of 2016, Zuozhi (George) Yang '17 further developed a Neato Vacuum 
Robot Monte Carlo Localization project by <a href="http://occam.olin.edu/">Paul 
Ruvalo</a>.&nbsp; Our CS 371 Mobile Robotics Monte Carlo Localization Challenge 
is to further improve upon the ability of our robot to:<ul>
	<li><strong>successfully localize</strong> with minimal prior information 
	(ideally just the map of the environment),</li>
	<li><strong>maintain correct localization</strong> robustly in the face of 
	frequent, complicated maneuvers, and</li>
	<li>ultimately <strong>be able to relocalize</strong> correctly when it is 
	suddenly repositioned (i.e. address the Kindapped Robot Problem).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to making improvements, it is our goal to <strong>document</strong> 
our improvements, data, experimental methods, observations, reasoning, and 
conclusions with such thoroughness and clarity as to empower future generations 
of students to extend improvements beyond our best performance.</p>
<p>To this end, each group will (1) select at least one area of focus, e.g.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Monte Carlo Localization algorithmic extensions (e.g. AMCL) and/or 
	parameter tuning (e.g. number of particles, number of sensors used),</li>
	<li>Improvement of our motion model through data collection, parameter 
	fitting, maximum likelihood estimation, etc.,</li>
	<li>Improvement of our sensor model through data collection, parameter 
	fitting, maximum likelihood estimation, etc., or</li>
	<li>Any other area of focus I approve of where you are able to propose a 
	reasonable empirical study that has a good possibility of yielding 
	improvements within the hardware, software, and algorithmic constraints of 
	the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Details, code, and supporting documentation have been supplied by George and 
will appear here in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>(75%) A zip file containing web-browsable documentation of:<ul>
		<li>(5%) Your area of focus,</li>
		<li>(10%) Your hypothesis of what improvements might be feasible within 
		this area of focus,</li>
		<li>(10%) Description of the measure (i.e. metric) you used to evaluate 
		the performance/success of your approach,</li>
		<li>(10%) Data collected along with a description of how the data should 
		be interpreted,</li>
		<li>(10%) Any algorithms you developed or modified (including parameter 
		changes) in pursuit of your improvements,</li>
		<li>(10%) A summary of your conclusions from your empirical research, 
		and</li>
		<li><strong>(20%) Anything a future student would need to know to (1) 
		repeat your experiments, and (2) apply their lessons and achieve the 
		same peformance improvements.&nbsp; </strong>If all of this is provided 
		in previous categories above, this 20% will be awarded automatically.&nbsp; 
		The test is whether or not I am provided with enough documentation to be 
		able to fully replicate your results.<strong><br></strong>(Note: Any 
		http links beyond your pages should be absolute (i.e. starting with 
		&quot;http://&quot;), whereas multple pages (if desired) should be linked to 
		relatively (e.g. starting with &quot;./pageInSameDirectory.html&quot;.&quot;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>(25%) An informal presentation summarizing your findings, demonstrating 
	improvements (if any), and noting the most significant thing you learned and 
	would pass along to another team performing the same work.</li>
