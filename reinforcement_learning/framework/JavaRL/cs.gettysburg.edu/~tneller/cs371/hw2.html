<p><b>1. Pancake Sorting with Flip Costs:&nbsp;</b> For this exercise, we 
will work with a variant of the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_sorting">Pancake Sorting Problem</a>&quot;.&nbsp; 
A stack of pancakes with different sizes is represented as a permutation of <em>p </em>integers {0, ... , <em>p</em>-1}.&nbsp; 
A &quot;flip&quot; of<em> n</em> pancakes reverses the order of the first<em> n</em> 
pancakes, and incurs a cost of <em>n</em>.&nbsp; Our goal is to seek a minimal 
total cost sequence of flips to sort a given pancake permutation.&nbsp; Consider the following example optimal solution for pancake sequence {5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 3, 6, 0}:

<pre>         5 2 7 4 1 3 6 0 cost: 0
flip 2: <span class="style1">2 5</span> 7 4 1 3 6 0 cost: 2
flip 4: <span class="style1">4 7 5 2</span> 1 3 6 0 cost: 6
flip 3: <span class="style1">5 7 4</span> 2 1 3 6 0 cost: 9
flip 2: <span class="style1">7 5</span> 4 2 1 3 6 0 cost: 11
flip 6: <span class="style1">3 1 2 4 5 7</span> 6 0 cost: 17
flip 3: <span class="style1">2 1 3</span> 4 5 7 6 0 cost: 20
flip 2: <span class="style1">1 2</span> 3 4 5 7 6 0 cost: 22
flip 7: <span class="style1">6 7 5 4 3 2 1</span> 0 cost: 29
flip 2: <span class="style1">7 6</span> 5 4 3 2 1 0 cost: 31
flip 8: <span class="style1">0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7</span> cost: 39
</pre>With the initial sequence, no cost is incurred.&nbsp; After flipping 
(reversing) the first 2 pancakes {5, 2}, a cost of 2 is accumulated.&nbsp; After 
next flipping the first 4 pancakes {2, 5, 7, 4}, the cumulative cost is then 6.&nbsp; 
Continuing on through all 10 flips, we reach a goal node with optimal (minimal) 
cost 39.&nbsp; (Optimal flip sequences may not be unique.)</p>
<p>Implement <span class="style2">HPancakeSortNode.java</span> according to
<a href="pancake-doc/HPancakeSortNode.html">this specification</a>.&nbsp; Have 
all the following necessary supporting classes (developed and/or specified in 
class) available in the same directory when you submit your work.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Pancake Sorting History: First discussed by mathematician Jacob Goodman, the 
Pancake Sorting Problem in its original form (with cost equal to depth of 
search, i.e. number of flips regardless of flip sizes) was of great interest to 
a sophomore at Harvard College who took on the research challenge and dropped 
out a year later.&nbsp; That sophomore's pancake sorting algorithm held the 
record for being the best for more than 30 years when it was bested in 2008 by 
researchers at UT Dallas.&nbsp; That Harvard sophomore dropout was Bill Gates.</p>
<p>This variant is my own design.</p>
