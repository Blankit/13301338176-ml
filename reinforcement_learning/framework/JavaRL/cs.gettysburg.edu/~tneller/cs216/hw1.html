<h1>Poker Squares Challenge Introduction</h1>
<p>0. Learn the rules of <a href="../games/pokersquares/index.html">Poker 
Squares</a> and play several games.&nbsp; Download the
<a href="../games/pokersquares/code">code</a> for our Spring 2013 Poker Squares 
programming competition. <p>1. Create and submit your own PokerSquaresPlayer, 
which should:<ul>
	<li>outperform the RandomPokerSquaresPlayer to receive credit,</li>
	<li>score 80 or higher on average to receive 90% credit,</li>
	<li>score 90 or higher on average to receive 95% credit, or</li>
	<li>score 90 or higher on average and have the highest average in our 
	section to receive 100% credit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please create a unique name for your player (e.g. one that makes use of team 
usernames, such as TnellerPokerSquaresPlayer1.java).</p>
<p>Note: If you are having difficulty scoring 80 or higher on average, meet with 
me to discuss strategies.&nbsp; I have a very simple 15-line implementation of 
getPlay() that achieves an average of 81.</p>
	<p>2. In your &quot;README&quot; plain text file, write 2-3 paragraphs explaining your 
	player design decisions, and describing ways in which you expect the player 
	may be improved.&nbsp;&nbsp; This exercise will plant seeds for the 
	mid-semester competition to come.</p>
