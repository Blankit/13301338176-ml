<h3>
Course Overview</h3>
The focus of this course is data structures, ways to organize data (e.g. linked 
lists, hash tables), and algorithms (e.g. sorting, searching), ways to process 
data.&nbsp; Our goal is to develop your problem-solving abilities by providing a 
deep understanding of the data structures and algorithms computer scientists 
find most useful.&nbsp; As you seek to solve new problems in the future, you 
will likely associate a new problem to similar problems
in your experience.&nbsp; Drawing from data structures and algorithms you've
previously encountered, you'll synthesize new approaches.&nbsp; Thus, it
is important for you to be equipped with valuable, broadly-applicable tools
for problem-solving.&nbsp; This is our primary aim.&nbsp; By implementing common data structures
and algorithms from language-neutral specification, you will gain a broad, language-independent maturity with data
structures and algorithms.
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Understand, implement, and test fundamental data structures such as 
	stacks, queues, hash tables, and binary search trees.</li>
	<li>Derive and compare computational time and space complexities to better 
	understand tradeoffs in data structures selection.</li>
	<li>Gain skill in the implementation of language-independent pseudocode 
	specifications.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Grading</h3>
 <p><span class="style1">70% Assignments <br>10% 4th Hour Requirement project<br>
10% Quizzes / Exams <br>
5% Colloquium Attendance<br>
5% Class Attendance / Participation 
</span></p>
<p>You are responsible to know the material from each lecture and reading 
assignment before the start of the next class.&nbsp; Homework is due <b>at 
the beginning of lecture on the due date.</b>&nbsp; Late homework will not
necessarily be accepted.&nbsp; Code must be a legal program in the relevant 
language in order to be graded.&nbsp; (It need not be free from logic errors.)&nbsp; 
For compiled languages, this means that the program must compile without error.&nbsp; 
For interpreted languages, this means it must be interpretable without error. <b>&nbsp; Source code 
with compilation/syntax errors may
not receive partial credit.&nbsp; </b>You are required to attend 2 colloquia or 
approved departmental events over the course of the semester.&nbsp; Class attendance and participation is
required.&nbsp; If you attend all classes and are willing to participate, 
you'll get 100% for this part of your grade.&nbsp; Even if you know enough 
to give a particular lecture, please consider the value of helping your peers
during in-class exercises. </p>
<h3> Honor Code</h3>
Honesty, Integrity, Honor.&nbsp; These are more important than anything
we will teach in this class.&nbsp; Students can and are encouraged to help
each other understand course concepts, but all graded work must be done
independently unless otherwise specified (e.g. group work).&nbsp; Submitted work 
should be created by those submitting it.&nbsp; Submission 
of plagiarized code or design work is a violation of the Honor Code, which I 
strictly enforce.&nbsp; For
detailed information about the Honor Code, see
<a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot">
http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot</a>.
<p>What is permitted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Discussing algorithms, syntax, and problem specifications with other 
	students</li>
	<li>Seeking assistance (as needed) from CS professors, students assistants, 
	and approved tutors</li>
	<li>Use of &quot;starter code&quot; supplied by your professor, or code you have 
	previously developed</li>
</ul>
<p>What is not permitted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sharing code: Verbal dictation of code, transference of code (e.g. 
	e-mail, file transfer, entry of printed output, etc.).&nbsp; An important 
	component of this experiential learning process is developing the ability to 
	independently devise algorithms and express them in program code.</li>
	<li>Viewing and/or using unauthorized code (e.g. solutions found online, 
	downloads from code repositories, etc.)</li>
	<li>Submitting work that implicitly takes credit for work that should be 
	credited to others</li>
	<li>Efforts to obscure the source of unauthorized work</li>
	<li>Outsourcing work</li>
</ul>
<p>Put simply, students may discuss assignments at an abstract level (e.g. 
specifications, algorithm pseudocode), but must actually implement solutions 
independently or in permitted groups.&nbsp; Credit should be given where credit 
is due.&nbsp; Let your conscience be your guide.&nbsp; Do not merely focus on 
the result; learn from the process.</p>
