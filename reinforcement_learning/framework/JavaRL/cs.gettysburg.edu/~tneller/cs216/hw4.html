<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Customizing MCInvest: </strong>[Complete and submit individually.] 
Take the Monte Carlo investing simulation (MCInvest.java) that we developed in 
class and customize it for your personal set of assumptions.&nbsp; Submit via 
paper, README, or MCInvest block comment a justification for your parameter 
choices (e.g. work years, savings rate, withdrawal rate, income replacement 
fraction, etc.) and describe any additional modifications you make to the 
simulation model.&nbsp; This is an opportunity to invest significant thought 
into choices in your near future that will significantly impact you and your 
family in the distant future.&nbsp; That's right: Here's an opportunity to get 
credit for taking the time to plan for your retirement investment strategy 
beyond graduation. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Rebalancing Illustration:</strong> (Note: The following scenario 
is not realistic, but rather illustrative.&nbsp; In the real world, asset 
classes with similar returns are often highly correlated.&nbsp; Rebalancing 
among asset classes with different returns drags performance towards the lesser 
return, yet serves to keep the asset proportions and thus the expected 
volatility stable as opposed to an expected increase over time as high risk - 
high reward assets grow out of proportion.)</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario:&nbsp; Two non-correlated domestic equity 
(stock) funds, A and B, had the same return geometric mean (1.093281) and 
standard deviation (0.202191) from 1928-2010.&nbsp; That is, returns in Java may 
be computed as 1.093281 + random.nextGaussian() * 0.202191, where random is an 
object of type Random.</p>
<p>Suppose one investor starts with half invested in A and half invested in B.&nbsp; 
A and B experience the same set of returns over 40 years, but in different 
random order.</p>
<p>Another investor rebalances once a year back to the initial 50%/50% balance 
between amounts in A and B.&nbsp; Assuming that the beginning balance is 1 (.5 
each in A and B), use Monte Carlo simulation (1,000,000 trials) to estimate and 
print the expected final balances for non-rebalancing and rebalancing scenarios.
</p>
<p>Implementation notes: In an array of length 40, generate 40 years of returns 
for fund A as described above. Then clone (copy) the array for B and shuffle it 
using the

Fisher-Yates Shuffle</a>.</p>
<h2>A Taste of AI - Part II</h2>
<p>3. <strong>Depth-Limited Search:</strong> Implement depth-limited search in 
DepthLimitedSearcher.java (extending Searcher), which has a constructor that 
takes a depth limit.</p>
<p>4.<strong> Iterative-Deepening Depth-First Search:</strong> Implement 
iterative-deepening depth-first search in IDDFSearcher.java.&nbsp; The 
implementation will make use of your DepthLimitedSearcher.</p>
