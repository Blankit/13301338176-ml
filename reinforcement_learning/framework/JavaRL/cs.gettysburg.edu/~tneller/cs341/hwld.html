<p><strong>Due: Various dates.&nbsp; See below.</strong></p>
<P><B>Note: </B>This work is to be done in <B>pairs</B>.&nbsp; Each pair will 
submit one assignment.&nbsp; Although you may divide the work, both team members 
should be able to present/describe their partner's work upon request.&nbsp;
<h1>Language Design Phase 1</h1>
<p>&nbsp;<B>Due: Thursday 10/19 at the beginning of class #15</B> </p>
<p>As our Fourth Hour project for the semester, you will be designing your own 
high level programming language and implementing an interpreter for it using 
JavaCC.&nbsp; As a first step you need to work through your design thoughts 
concretely by writing example implementations using your proposed language.</p>
<p>Implement all 6 algorithms of <a href="hw1.html">Homework #1</a> using your 
proposed language.&nbsp; You should at this point have working examples in a 
number of languages, so the challenge should not be algorithmic.&nbsp; Rather, 
you will be focused on the design of your language.</p>
<p>To submit this homework, email or physically submit your code to me directly.&nbsp;
</p>
<h1>Language Design Phase 2</h1>
<p>&nbsp;<B>Due: 11/7 at the beginning of class #20</B> </p>
<ol>
	<li>Create source files in your language for the maximum and factorial 
	problems of <a href="hw1.html">Homework #1</a>.&nbsp; Call these <strong>maximum.txt</strong> 
	and <strong>factorial.txt.</strong></li>
	<li>Implement an interpreter for your language that can, using the JavaCC 
	command &quot;javacc <strong>MyLang.jj</strong>&quot; and the java compiler command &quot;javac 
	<strong>MyLang.java</strong>&quot;, create a Java executable that can interpret a source code file 
	&lt;src&gt; and input file &lt;in&gt; as follows: &quot;java MyLang &lt;src&gt;&nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; 
	&lt;in&gt;&quot;, where &lt;src&gt; is one of the source code files of step 1.</li>
	<li>Submit your interpreter and source code from the directory containing 
	them using the command &quot;<strong>submit341 ld1</strong>&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Language Design Phase 3</h1>
<p>&nbsp;<B>Due: 11/16 at the beginning of class #23</B> </p>
<ol>
	<li>Create additional source files in your language for the unique and 
	quicksort problems of <a href="hw1.html">Homework #1</a>.&nbsp; Call these 
	<strong>unique.txt</strong> and <strong>quicksort.txt</strong>.</li>
	<li>Implement an interpreter for your language that can, using the JavaCC 
	command &quot;javacc <strong>MyLang.jj</strong>&quot; and the java compiler command &quot;javac 
	<strong>MyLang.java</strong>&quot;, create a Java executable that can interpret a source code file 
	&lt;src&gt; and input file &lt;in&gt; as follows: &quot;java MyLang &lt;src&gt;&nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; 
	&lt;in&gt;&quot;, where &lt;src&gt; is one of the source code files of step 1.&nbsp; All 
	source code files of phase 2 and phase 3 should function correctly.</li>
	<li>Submit your interpreter and source code from the directory containing 
	them using the command &quot;<strong>submit341 ld2</strong>&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Language Design Phase 4</h1>
<p>&nbsp;<B>Due: 11/30 at the beginning of class #26</B> </p>
<ol>
	<li>Create additional source files in your language for the binary search 
	tree and breadth-first search problems of <a href="hw1.html">Homework #1</a>.&nbsp; 
	Call these <strong>binary-search-tree.txt</strong> and <strong>breadth-first-search.txt</strong>.</li>
	<li>Implement an interpreter for your language that can, using the JavaCC 
	command &quot;javacc <strong>MyLang.jj</strong>&quot; and the java compiler command &quot;javac 
	<strong>MyLang.java</strong>&quot;, create a Java executable that can interpret a source code file 
	&lt;src&gt; and input file &lt;in&gt; as follows: &quot;java MyLang &lt;src&gt;&nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; 
	&lt;in&gt;&quot;, where &lt;src&gt; is one of the source code files of step 1.&nbsp; All 
	source code files of phases 2, 3, and 4 should function correctly.</li>
	<li>Submit your interpreter and source code from the directory containing 
	them using the command &quot;<strong>submit341 ld3</strong>&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that, for phases 3 and 4, you'll include the source code for problems of 
previous phases.</p>
