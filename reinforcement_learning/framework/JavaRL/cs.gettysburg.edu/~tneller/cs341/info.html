<h3>
Course Overview</h3>
This course surveys three programming languages/paradigms: the functional 
language Scheme, and multi-paradigm, dynamically-typed Python and event-driven 
Android Java-based programming.&nbsp; More than a
survey course, however, this course covers fundamental design decisions
at the core of every programming language.&nbsp; The larger first part of the
course will explore such issues in the context of the programming language
Scheme.&nbsp; We will learn the techniques necessary to implement a simple 
Scheme interpreter in Java.&nbsp; The second part of the course will allow students 
to master of the basics of two popular and practical languages
(Python and Android) while gaining an understanding of these languages in the general context
of programming language design.&nbsp; This course is analogous to linguistics
course teaching the basics of three languages, where the first language
is chosen to challenge the student's assumptions about languages, and the
others are chosen to provide a foundation for future practice and reinforce
general understanding about languages.&nbsp; As a fourth hour project students 
will design, specify, and build an interpreter for their own general purpose 
programming language.<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Design, code, test, and debug programs in a few representative language 
	of different programming paradigms.</li>
	<li>Learn how to design a programming language by creating a functional language 
	interpreter and an interpreter for a student-designed language.</li>
	<li>Formalize the notion of typing, differentiating between static and 
	dynamic typing, and evaluating languages with regard to typing.</li>
	<li>Explain the different major programming paradigms, and design, code, test, and debug simple event-driven programs 
	that respond to user events.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Grading</h3>
80% Assignments <br>
10% Exam(s) <br>
5% Colloquium Attendance<br>
5% Class Attendance / Participation 
<p>You are responsible to know the material from each lecture and reading 
assignment before the start of the next class.&nbsp; Homework is due <b>at 
the beginning of lecture on the due date.</b>&nbsp; Late homework will not
necessarily be accepted.&nbsp; Code must be a legal program in the relevant 
language in order to be graded.&nbsp; (It need not be free from logic errors.)&nbsp; 
For compiled languages, this means that the program must compile without error.&nbsp; 
For interpreted languages, this means it must be interpretable without error. <b>&nbsp; Source code 
with compilation/syntax errors may
not receive partial credit.&nbsp; </b>You are required to attend 3 colloquia or 
approved departmental events over the course of the semester.&nbsp; Class attendance and participation is
required.&nbsp; If you attend all classes and are willing to participate, 
you'll get 100% for this part of your grade.&nbsp; Even if you know enough 
to give a particular lecture, please consider the value of helping your peers
during in-class exercises. </p>
<h3> Honor Code</h3>
Honesty, Integrity, Honor.&nbsp; These are more important than anything
we will teach in this class.&nbsp; Students can and are encouraged to help
each other understand course concepts, but all graded work must be done
independently unless otherwise specified (e.g. group work).&nbsp; Submitted work 
should be created by those submitting it.&nbsp; Submission 
of plagiarized code or design work is a violation of the Honor Code, which I 
strictly enforce.&nbsp; For
detailed information about the Honor Code, see
<a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot">
http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot</a>.
<p>What is permitted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Discussing algorithms, syntax, and problem specifications with other 
	students</li>
	<li>Seeking assistance (as needed) from CS professors, students assistants, 
	and approved tutors</li>
	<li>Use of &quot;starter code&quot; supplied by your professor, or code you have 
	previously developed</li>
</ul>
<p>What is not permitted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sharing code: Verbal dictation of code, transference of code (e.g. 
	e-mail, file transfer, entry of printed output, etc.).&nbsp; An important 
	component of this experiential learning process is developing the ability to 
	independently devise algorithms and express them in program code.</li>
	<li>Viewing and/or using unauthorized code (e.g. solutions found online, 
	downloads from code repositories, etc.)</li>
	<li>Submitting work that implicitly takes credit for work that should be 
	credited to others</li>
	<li>Efforts to obscure the source of unauthorized work</li>
	<li>Outsourcing work</li>
</ul>
<p>Put simply, students may discuss assignments at an abstract level (e.g. 
specifications, algorithm pseudocode), but must actually implement solutions 
independently or in permitted groups.&nbsp; Credit should be given where credit 
is due.&nbsp; Let your conscience be your guide.&nbsp; Do not merely focus on 
the result; learn from the process.</p>
