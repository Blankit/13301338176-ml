<h1>
Electronic Homework Submission</h1>
All programming work for this course should be submitted electronically
using the <tt>submit</tt> command.
<p>To be able to use this command, you must first edit the file <tt>.cshrc</tt>
in your home directory (<tt>~/.cshrc</tt>) and add the line "<tt>set path=($path
/Apps)</tt>".
<p>The submit command assumes that all work for a homework assignment is
stored in its own directory.&nbsp; You might, for instance create a directory
"<tt>cs104</tt>" and then create subdirectories "<tt>hw1</tt>", "<tt>hw2</tt>",
etc.
<p>To use this command, <tt>cd</tt> (change directory) to your work directory.&nbsp;
After entering "<tt>ls</tt>", you should be able to see the parts necessary
for submission:
<ol>
<li>
<tt>README</tt> - a plain text file README with (1) the <a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/college_life/orgs/honor_code/">honor
code</a> statement, (2) your name and (3) student ID number (which serve
as your electronic signature), and (4) a description of the .java files
in your work directory (what programmers conventionally put in a README
file).</li>

<li>
<tt>_____.java</tt> - Java source file(s) for the assignment</li>

<li>
(For assignments with Java applets, you will also need to submit <tt>*.html</tt>
files.)</li>
</ol>
Now enter the command "<tt>submit cs#### hw#</tt>" where <tt>cs####</tt>
is your course/section and <tt>hw# </tt>is the assignment.&nbsp; For example,
to submit the first homework assignment for CS 104, section A, you would
enter "<tt>submit cs104a hw1</tt>".&nbsp; Then follow the instructions.&nbsp;
If you submit your work twice, the old copy is eliminated and no record
is kept.&nbsp; The latest time of submission is recorded for grading purposes.
<p>If you have any problems with this script please contact Professor Neller
as soon as possible with an e-mail description of the problem and a copy
of the error message.
