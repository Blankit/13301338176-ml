<h3>
Course Overview</h3>
The objective of this course is to give each student a taste of research
in computer science. There will be three 4-5 week projects involving search
and machine-learning techniques.&nbsp; Each problem will be a challenging,
"open" research problem.&nbsp; The three project are as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
AI search for a motion planning problem (submarine detection avoidance)</li>

<li>
machine-learning for a bidding game (Medici)</li>

<li>
machine-learning for adaptive virtual robots (Unreal)</li>
</ul>

<p><br>Each project will consist of these phases:
<ul>
<li>
problem definition/formalization</li>

<li>
background reading/learning</li>

<li>
current technique implementation</li>

<li>
current technique experimentation/critique</li>

<li>
effort to create an improved technique</li>

<li>
documentation of experiment and analysis of results</li>
</ul>

<p><br>As this is a project course, a student would ideally:
<ul>
<li>
feel comfortable with their programming skills</li>

<li>
want to learn a bit about the process of research</li>

<li>
want to exercise creativity in problem solving</li>

<li>
think games are pretty cool investment of programming energy</li>
</ul>

<p>The Russell &amp; Norvig text was used in CS 371 (Artificial Intelligence)
and will be used for coverage of basic search concepts.&nbsp; This text
is not officially required for this course because (1) We'll only spend
the first couple weeks with the search material, and (2) students should
be able to borrow this text from previous AI students or find it on reserve
in the library.&nbsp; If this poses too much inconvenience, you can order
the book easily through Amazon.com.
<p>The Machine Learning text is expensive and relevant to the second and
third projects.&nbsp; A copy will also be on reserve in the library.
<p>Beyond the context of this course, I'd recommend the Russell &amp; Norvig
book for a general AI introduction, and I'd recommend the Mitchell book
for its coverage of AI maching learning material.

<h3>
Grading</h3>
90% Projects (3 projects, each made up of multiple component)
<br>10% Class Attendance/Participation
<p>This course will be run very much like an independent research course.&nbsp;
A subset of the lectures times will be used to present material relevant
to 3 major research projects.&nbsp; Beyond the lectures, expect to report
approximately weekly on progress.&nbsp; Research is often a self-motivated
venture.&nbsp; Although I will provide guidance for when you should complete
various stages, you must find within yourself the desire and discipline
for success in this endeavor.&nbsp; Accordingly, "due dates" may be individualized.
<p>Class attendance and participation is required unless (1) you have taken
the lecture topic in CS 371, and (2) you're sure that nothing beyond the
topic will be covered or discussed.&nbsp; The class attendance and participation
portion of your grade will therefore reflect your attendance for lectures
with new material and/or class discussion, and your punctuality for scheduled
status report meetings.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Honor Code</h3>
Honesty, Integrity, Honor.&nbsp; These are more important than anything
we will teach in this class.&nbsp; Since you will be encouraged to work
in groups, the most important application of the honor code is that you
represent the extent of your project contributions accurately.&nbsp; For
detailed information about the honor code, see
<br><a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/college_life/orgs/honor_code/index.html">http://www.gettysburg.edu/college_life/orgs/honor_code/index.html</a>.
