<p class="MsoPlainText">With simple rules and surprisingly complex solutions, 
this <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jump-maze/id374674773?mt=8&uo=6" target="itunes_store">free Jump Maze app</a> offers a fun mental challenge with 10,000
<a href="index.html">Rook Jumping Mazes</a> (a.k.a. Number Mazes).&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Each maze is a grid of numbers with a goal square marked 
&quot;G&quot;.&nbsp; Each number indicates how many squares one must move horizontally or 
vertically from that square.&nbsp; Starting in the upper-leftmost square, one tries 
to reach the goal square with the fewest moves.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">There is no time pressure.&nbsp; There are no dead ends.&nbsp; 
There is a path to the goal from each square.&nbsp; Once you reach the goal, the 
shortest solution length is revealed.&nbsp; You can try again to find a better path, 
or you can try a new maze at any time.&nbsp; An optional Hints feature highlights the 
squares you have reached.&nbsp; Review the rules through the tutorial, or jump right 
in and play.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">This mental snack is offered for your puzzling pleasure 
from the students and faculty of <a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/">Gettysburg 
College</a>'s <a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>.&nbsp; 
Enjoy!</p>
