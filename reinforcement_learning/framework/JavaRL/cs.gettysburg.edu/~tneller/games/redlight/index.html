<img alt="Red Light Materials" height="200" longdesc="Red Light Materials: Bag and Poker Chips or Playing Cards" src="red-light-materials-300w.jpg" style="float: right" width="300">Red Light is a jeopardy chip/card game by Todd Neller based on the Gamewright jeopardy card game 
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7610/fowl-play">Fowl Play</a> which is, in turn,
based on the folk jeopardy dice game <a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/">Pig</a>.</p>
<p>The two-player version introduced
<a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/papers/fowlplay.pdf">here</a> can be 
played with 4 red poker chips (&#8220;red lights&#8221;), 24 green poker chips (&#8220;green 
lights&#8221;), and a bag or container that allows players to shuf&#64258;e and randomly draw 
concealed chips.&nbsp; One can also play the game with standard playing cards 
using the Ace through 7 of each suit and having the 4 Aces and 24 other cards 
representing red and green lights, respectively.</p>
<p>The object of the two-player game is to be the first player to reach 50 
points.&nbsp; The non-starting player begins with 1 point.</p>
<p>One a player's turn, the player draws one or more chips.&nbsp; If the drawn 
chip is a green light, the player sets it aside in a &#8220;turn total&#8221; pile. After 
drawing, the player then decides whether to <strong>draw</strong> again or
<strong>hold</strong>. If the player holds, the number of green lights in the 
turn total pile are scored, the chips are placed in a discard pile, and play 
passes to the next player. If the drawn chip is a red light, the player scores 
nothing for the turn, places all chips in the discard pile, and play passes to 
the next player. If the red chip was the last, fourth red light, all discarded chips 
are returned to the bag or container and shuf&#64258;ed before the next turn.

</p>
<p>Note: The number of red and green chips for Red Light was chosen by varying 
the number of chips in play, analyzing the game, and optimizing komi (i.e. 
compensation points). We found an extraordinarily good approximation of a fair 
game for 4 red and 24 green chips with a komi of 1, deviating from a fair 
win probability by 0.00001. With larger numbers of total chips, the game length 
shortens, and the ideal komi increases. We have opted for smaller numbers of 
chips (&lt; 50) in our design because poker chips are often sold in units of 25 
or 50.&nbsp; For more details, see the analysis in this research article:</p>

<p>In the fall of 2013, <a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/">Gettysburg College</a>
<a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/">Computer Science</a> 112 students 
(Michael Booz, John Duncan, Jeff Kohart, Edward Makinde, and Steven Semmel), 
Prof. Todd Neller, and Marcin Malec '13 created an Android app called &quot;Red Light 
Race&quot; for the two-player game 
described above.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="style1">Game play tips:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Press the
	&quot;Go&quot; button to draw another chip from the remaining red and 
	green chips.</li>
	<li>
		Press the &quot;Stop&quot; button to end your turn and score the turn total (i.e. 
		the number of green chips you have drawn).</li>
	<li>
		Sound cues:<ul>
			<li>car rushing past: green chip drawn</li>
			<li>car skid: red chip drawn</li>
			<li>motor rev down: scoring and end of turn</li>
			<li>beep beep: all chips being reshuffled</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li>Strategy Hints:&nbsp; Highlight between brackets to reveal hints.&nbsp; 
	However, we recommend that you first play the game first to see what 
	strategy you discover on your own.
	<ol>
		<li>[<span class="style4">Is your turn total multiplied by the number of 
		reds remaining greater than or equal to the number of greens remaining?</span>]</li>
		<li>[<span class="style4">If so, Stop and you will be maximizing the 
		expected number of points per turn.</span>]</li>
		<li>[<span class="style4">This, however, is not the same as optimal 
		play. The optimal player will take greater/lesser risks when 
		behind/ahead in score, respectively.&nbsp; Also, there exist situations 
		in which the optimal player will deliberately draw a red chip.&nbsp; Can you think of one?</span>]
		</li>
		<li>[<span class="style4">Suppose there are 3 chips remaining: 2 red and 
		1 green.&nbsp; After drawing the only green chip, the optimal player will then deliberately 
		draw a red chip, forcing the opponent to draw the final red chip, refreshing the chips 
		for a better expected score on the optimal player's next turn.</span>]</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="style1">Our goal was to create a human versus computer game version 
with a racing theme that featured:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	multiple skill levels ranging from an overly-conservative &quot;Easy&quot; 
	opponent to an approximately optimal &quot;Hard&quot; opponent	</li>
	<li>
	game statistics including win rates against each opponent	</li>
	<li>
	aan ability to test the fairness of the computer play by 
	allowing the user to generate the random events with chip/card draws in Test 
	Mode	</li>
</ul>
<p>
Optimal play of the game was computed by Todd Neller, but a memory-efficient 
artificial neural network that closely approximates optimal play was trained 
from this optimal play by Marcin Malec.&nbsp; Your smartphones have Marcin to 
thank for packing high-quality play in a low memory footprint.&nbsp; The total 
number of possible non-end-game situations in this 2-player Red Light game is 
6,375,000. Marcin's neural network boils decision making down to a mere 118 
numbers (i.e. about 0.002% of the memory cost) while performing within 1% of the 
optimal win rate.</p>
