<p>As mentioned in the &quot;Starting Out&quot; section of my <a href="gameinfo.html">
recommendations for game resources</a>, one can maximize diversity of game 
playing options with a minimum of money by getting a pencil and paper, playing 
cards, dice and cups, a Chess set, and Poker chips.&nbsp; Concerning the Chess 
set and Poker chips in combination, a few games were recommended.&nbsp; This 
page expands those recommendations.&nbsp; It is not meant to be exhaustive, but 
rather a place to collect my recommendations and links to relevant online 
resources.&nbsp; Feel free to recommend others to me as well!&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Chess set alone</strong> - Chess has a rich history and allows 
	great depth of study, but there are also many Chess variations and puzzles 
	that can be played with a standard set.<ul>

		The Game of Chess (Algebraic Edition)</a> by Siegbert Tarrasch</li>
		<li>Wholesale Chess - an excellent online store for chess supplies.&nbsp; 
		There are many bad, cheap plastic chess/checker sets in stores.&nbsp; 
		For a good budget set, look for standard board size sets with vinyl mat 
		boards, plastic pieces, and storage bags in the
		<a href="http://www.wholesalechess.com/shop/chess_sets/club_chess_sets">
		Club Chess Set</a> section.&nbsp; While still relatively inexpensive, I 
		enjoy the

	</li>
	<li><strong>Chess set with Poker chips</strong> - Beyond Poker, Poker chips may be used for a variety of 
	games with a Chess set.<ul>
		<li>Poker chips may be 
		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009TP1OC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=towneho-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217153&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B0009TP1OC">purchased separately</a>, or as part of a

		aluminum cases can be a great value.&nbsp; Generally the included cards 
		(and sometimes dice) are very poor quality, so focus on the weight of 
		the chips and the portability.</li>
		<li>Use the Poker chips on a Chess board to play other games such as:<ul>
			<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achi_(game)">Achi</a> - 
			Play on a 3x3 subsection of the Chess board (e.g. columns a - c, 
			rows 1 - 3). </li>
			<li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2125">Amazons</a> - 
		Originally called
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Amazons">El Juego de 
		las Amazonas</a> (&quot;The Game of the Amazons&quot;), this is an excellent 
		abstract territorial strategy game with very simple rules, yet lots of 
		depth to grow in interest as one grows.&nbsp; As of this writing, only a 
		paper grid version can be easily purchased from
			<a href="http://www.gamepuzzles.com/abstrct3.htm#AM">Kadon</a>.&nbsp; 
		However, one can play a smaller variation with a Chess set and Poker 
		chips as follows: Use pawns for Amazon pieces and Poker chips to mark 
		squares with arrows.&nbsp; Place white pawns at A3, C1, F1, and H3 of the 
		chessboard.&nbsp; Place black pawns at A6, C8, F8, and H6.&nbsp; Beyond the setup, 
		rules follow as in the
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Amazons">Wikipedia 
		article</a>.</li>
			<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxx">Ataxx</a> - When 
			using Poker chips, stack contrasting color chips as with

			square a1 be the &quot;poisoned&quot; square of chocolate, and form an <em>m</em>-by-<em>n</em> 
			rectangle of poker pieces for the initial setup.&nbsp; Players 
			alternate &quot;chomping&quot; by choosing a chip, and removing that chip and 
			any chips in the rectangular region from that position to h8, i.e. 
			having row and column greater than or equal to the chosen chip row 
			and column.<ul>
				<li><a href="http://lpcs.math.msu.su/~pentus/abacus.htm">Play 
				Chomp online</a></li>
				<li>Variant: Within the <em>m</em>-by-<em>n</em> rectangle, 
				randomly distribute <em>p</em> peanuts represented by 
				contrasting-colored chips.&nbsp; Each player is limited to 
				removing no more than a positive number <em>q</em> peanuts (as 
				in &quot;quit eating all the peanuts!&quot;).&nbsp; The normal 
				strategy-stealing argument for a first-player win doesn't hold 
				when there is a peanut in the far corner and the second player 
				response chomps <em>q</em> peanuts.&nbsp; (Note: I can't 
				remember if I created this variant or not.&nbsp; If you find a 
				reference to it or a specialization of it, please let me know.&nbsp; 
				Also, if you recommend a ratio of p to m*n or a value of q, I 
				would be interested in your observations.) </li>

				and &#8220;white&#8221;.&nbsp; In Go, pieces are placed on the intersections of a 
				19x19 grid, and practice games are often played on a 9x9 grid.&nbsp; 
				Happily, the intersections at the corners of squares on the

		and small game tokens.</li>
				<li>If playing with two colors of chips on a chess board, one 
				can work the setup as follows:<ul>
					<li>Players decide the starting player.&nbsp; Beginning with the 
					starting player, players create the ice floe by taking turns 
					placing 21 chips of one color (e.g. red) on the chess 
					board.&nbsp; Each of these chips represents a section of the ice 
					floe containing 2 fish.</li>
					<li>Chips of a second color (e.g. blue) are placed in the 
					remaining empty spaces on the chess board.&nbsp; Each of these 
					chips represents a section of the ice of the ice floe 
					containing 1 fish. </li>
					<li>Beginning with the non-starting player, players take 
					turns placing one of 4 penguins (pawns) each on top of the 
					chips.&nbsp; The starting player uses black pawns. </li>

			<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight's_tour">Knights Tour</a> 
			puzzles - Place chips in a pattern on the Chess board (e.g. whole 
			board, 5-by-6 subgrid, etc.), place the Knight on a chip, and see if 
			it's possible to visit every chip using Knight moves.&nbsp; Remove 
			each chip from the board as you visit it with the Knight.&nbsp; </li>

				<li>Select a section of the Chess board (e.g. rectangular 
				subgrid) and cover it with Reversi/Othello-type piece stacks 
				with the dark color chip on top of the light color chip.&nbsp; Select a switching rule, for example:<ul>
					<li>When selected, a piece and all pieces orthogonally 
					(horizontally and vertically) adjacent are switched.</li>
					<li>When selected, a piece and all pieces orthogonally 
					(horizontally and vertically) and diagonally adjacent are 
					switched.</li>
					<li>When selected, a piece and all pieces in the same row 
					or column are switched.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>One player creates the puzzle by selecting a sequence of 
				pieces, performing the chosen switching rule for each selection, 
				and then announcing the number of selections.</li>
				<li>The other player tries to restore the board to its original 
				&quot;lights out&quot; condition by selecting a sequence of pieces, using 
				the same chosen switching rule.&nbsp; If desired, the solving 
				player seeks to restore the board with the least number of 
				selections, less than or equal to the number announced.</li>

			Chess board with Poker chips by designating squares as specific 
			&quot;pits&quot; and stacking chips on a square to &quot;sow seeds&quot; in a &quot;pit&quot;.&nbsp; 
			While losing the tactile sowing feel of traditional Mancala games, 
			the games are still functionally the same, and in some cases, chip
