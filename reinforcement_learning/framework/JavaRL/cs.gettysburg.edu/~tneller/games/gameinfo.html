<p>These are recommended starting points for learning more about board games, 
and exploring gaming as a hobby.&nbsp; Lists here are just a small sampling of 
high quality resources for gamers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/">BoardGameGeek.com</a> (a.k.a. BGG) is 
the IMDB of board games, with massive user-contributed content for over 73,000 
games and expansions as of October 2014.&nbsp; In addition to basic facts about 
publisher, publication date, number of player, time to play, etc., one can 
browse images, find sellers, read reviews, discuss strategy, download player 
aids, find relevant websites, and much more.</p>
<p>A good place to start looking for &quot;gateway&quot; games, i.e. games that are best 
for introducing oneself or others to modern boardgames, is to

<h1>Awards</h1>
<p>There are so many new games each year, it can be overwhelming to try to get a 
sense of the cream of the crop.&nbsp; It's helpful to peruse a number of annual 
awards to see which games stand out on multiple lists.&nbsp; Which awards you 
pay attention to will depend on your own tastes, but these are ones I tend to 
watch:</p>
<ul>

<h1>Books</h1>
<p>I recommend these as the foundation books for a game library:</p>

<p>A good way to get good deals on used books, etc. at Amazon is to use
<a href="http://camelcamelcamel.com/">camelcamelcamel.com</a> to get an idea of 
the typical price range (e.g.
<a href="http://camelcamelcamel.com/Games-Treasury-Merilyn-Simonds-Mohr/product/1576300587?active=price_used">
The New Games Treasury</a>) and to set up a free watch and notification for when 
an item price drops to or below your desired limit.</p>
<h1>Starting Out</h1>
<p>I often wonder what would be <em>best first game purchases that would provide the 
most board and card gaming value for the money</em>.&nbsp; These are my current 
recommendations.&nbsp; In most cases, these recommendations reflect a balance of 
price and quality considerations, and one can generally find lower prices (with 
lesser quality) or higher quality (with higher prices).&nbsp; The best beginner 
game kits would be constructed by buying good quality components in bulk and 
dividing them among a group of gamers.&nbsp; This would be fun to do someday... 
&quot;Professor Todd's Bag of Games&quot; anyone?
<ul>
	<li><strong>Playing Cards</strong> - You can't do much better than a low-cost, high-quality 
	deck of cards (e.g.
