Abstract:

This dissertation explores new algorithmic approaches to
simulation-based optimization, game-tree search, and tree search for
the control and analysis of hybrid systems.  Hybrid systems are
systems that evolve with both discrete and continuous behaviors.
Examples of hybrid systems include diverse mode-switching systems such
as those we have used as focus problems: stepper motors, magnetic
levitation units, and submarine detection avoidance scenarios.  For
hybrid systems with complex dynamics, the designer may have little
other than simulation as a tool to detect design flaws or inform
offline or real-time control.  In approaching control and analysis of
such systems, we thus limit ourselves to a black-box simulation of the
system.

Among our algorithmic contributions are:
- the first multi-dimensional information-based optimization approach,
- a generalization of previous multi-level optimization methods,
- information-based alpha-beta game-tree search,
- syntheses of cell-mapping and game-tree search techniques,
- iterative refinement approaches for dynamic action timing discretization,
- a best-first search variant with dynamic time-step refinement,
- iterative refinement with an epsilon variant of recursive best-first
  search, and  
- a dispersion technique for dynamic action parameter discretization.
We also formally define several hybrid system game-tree and tree
search problems.
