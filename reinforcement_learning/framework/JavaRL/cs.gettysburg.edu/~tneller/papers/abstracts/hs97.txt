Title: Heuristic Optimization and Dynamical System Safety Verification

Abstract: Given a heuristic estimate of the relative safety of a
hybrid dynamical system trajectory, we transform the initial safety
problem for dynamical systems into a global optimization problem.  We
compare untuned performance of several Simulated Annealing and Multi
Level Single Linkage method variants, and discuss the dynamic use of
knowledge gained during optimization.
