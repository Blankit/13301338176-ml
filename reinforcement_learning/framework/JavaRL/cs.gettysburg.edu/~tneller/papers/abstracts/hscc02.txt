Title: Information-Based Alpha-Beta Search and the Homicidal Chauffeur

Abstract: The standard means of applying a discrete search to a
continuous or hybrid system is the uniform discretization of control
actions and action timing.  Such discretization is fixed a priori and
does not allow search to benefit from information gained at run-time.
This paper introduces Information-Based Alpha-Beta Search, a new
algorithm that preserves and benefits from the continuous or hybrid
nature of the search.  In a novel merging of alpha-beta game-tree
search and information-based optimization, Information-Based
Alpha-Beta Search makes trajectory-sampling decisions dynamically
based on the maximum-likelihood of search pruning.  The result is a
search algorithm which, while incurring higher computational overhead
for the optimization, manages to so increase the quality of the
sampling, that the net effect is a significant increase in
performance.  We present a new piecewise-parabolic variant of the
algorithm and provide empirical evidence of its performance relative
to random and uniform discretizations in the context of a variant of
the homicidal chauffeur game.
