Title: Algorithms for Real-Time Game-Tree Search for Hybrid System
Control

Abstract:

This paper describes four algorithms for real-time game-tree search
for hybrid system control.  A hybrid system control game is a hybrid
system with discretely and continuously evolving scores, and an
enabled action set for each player.  As computational speed increases,
we can expect simulation to become more useful for informing control
decisions in real-time.  To this end, we seek to extend existing
game-tree search techniques for real-time hybrid system control.

We introduce the notion of an $n$-player augmented cell-map and apply
both dynamic programming and an anytime minimax algorithm with
caching.  For games with zero-sum scores, we generalize alpha-beta for
$n$-players.  Combining the best characteristics of these algorithms,
we introduce a generalized caching alpha-beta algorithm for graphs.
We discuss the benefits and limitations of each algorithm.
