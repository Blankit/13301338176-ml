Title: Preliminary Thoughts on the Application of Real-Time AI
Game-Tree Search to Control

Abstract:

We introduce a formal definition of a general hybrid system control
game, and a decision procedure for an agent which uses simulation to
inform game-playing decisions in real-time.  We discuss heuristics
informing the estimation of expected utilities of actions, describe
metalevel reasoning criteria which direct game-tree expansion
according to decision relevance, and point out challenges in applying
ideas from AI real-time game-tree search to control.
