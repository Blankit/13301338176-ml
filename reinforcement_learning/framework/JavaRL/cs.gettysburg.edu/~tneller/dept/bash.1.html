<A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3"><H2><B>DESCRIPTION</B></H2></A>
<B>Bash</B> is an <B>sh</B>-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. <B>Bash</B> also incorporates useful features from the <I>Korn</I> and <I>C</I> shells (<B>ksh</B> and <B>csh</B>).<P>
<B>Bash</B> is ultimately intended to be a faithful implementation of the IEEE Posix Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).<P>
<A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4"><H2><B>OPTIONS</B></H2></A>
In addition to the single-character shell options documented in the description of the <B>set</B> builtin command, <B>bash</B> interprets the following flags when it is invoked:<P>
<dl>
<dt><B>-c</B> <I>string</I> If<dd>the <B>-c</B> flag is present, then commands are read from <I>string</I>. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-i</B><dd>If the <B>-i</B> flag is present, the shell is <I>interac</I><I>tive</I>. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-s</B><dd>If the <B>-s</B> flag is present, or if no arguments remain after option processing, then commands are read from the standard input. This option allows the positional parameters to be set when invoking an interactive shell. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-</B><dd>A single <B>-</B> signals the end of options and disables further option processing. Any arguments after the <B>-</B> are treated as filenames and arguments. An argument of <B>--</B> is equivalent to an argument of <B>-</B>.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>Bash</B> also interprets a number of multi-character options. These options must appear on the command line before the single-character options to be recognized.<P>
<dl>
<dt><B>-norc</B><dd>Do not load the personal initialization file <I>~/.bashrc</I> if the shell is interactive. This is the default if the shell is invoked as <B>sh</B>. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-noprofile</B><dd> Do not read either the system-wide startup file <I>/etc/profile</I> or any of the personal initialization files <I>~/.bash_profile</I>, <I>~/.bash_login</I>, or <I>~/.profile</I>. By default, <B>bash</B> normally reads these files when it is invoked as a login shell.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-rcfile</B> <I>file</I><dd> Execute commands from <I>file</I> instead of the standard personal initialization file <I>~/.bashrc</I>, if the shell is interactive. </dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-nobraceexpansion</B><dd> Do not perform curly brace expansion (see <B>Brace</B> <B>Expansion</B> below). </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-nolineediting</B><dd> Do not use the GNU <I>readline</I> library to read command lines if interactive. </dd>

<A NAME="sect5" HREF="#toc5"><H2><B>ARGUMENTS</B></H2></A>
If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the <B>-c</B> nor the <B>-s</B> option has been supplied, the first argument is assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands. If <B>bash</B> is invoked in this fashion, <B>$0</B> is set to the name of the file, and the positional parameters are set to the remaining arguments. <B>Bash</B> reads and executes commands from this file, then exits.<P>
<A NAME="sect6" HREF="#toc6"><H2><B>DEFINITIONS</B></H2></A>
<B>blank</B> A space or tab.<BR>
 <B>word</B> A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell. Also known as a <B>token</B>. <B>name</B> A <I>word</I> consisting only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, and beginning with an alphabetic character or an underscore. Also referred to as an <B>identifier</B>.<BR>
 <B>metacharacter</B><BR>
 A character that, when unquoted, separates words. One of the following:<BR>
 <B>|</B> <B>&</B> <B>;</B> <B>(</B> <B>)</B> <B>&lt;</B> <B>&gt;</B> <B>&lt;space&gt;</B> <B>&lt;tab&gt;</B> <B>control</B> <B>operator</B><BR>
 A <I>token</I> that performs a control function. It is one of the following symbols:<BR>
 <B>||</B> <B>&</B> <B>&&</B> <B>;</B> <B>;;</B> <B>(</B> <B>)</B> <B>|</B> <B>&lt;newline&gt;</B><P>
<A NAME="sect7" HREF="#toc7"><H2><B>RESERVED</B> <B>WORDS</B></H2></A>
<I>Reserved</I> <I>words</I> are words that have a special meaning to the shell. The following words are recognized as reserved when unquoted and either the first word of a simple command (see <B>SHELL</B> <B>GRAMMAR</B> below) or the third word of a <B>case</B> or <B>for</B> command:<P>
<B>!</B> <B>case</B> <B>do</B> <B>done</B> <B>elif</B> <B>else</B> <B>esac</B> <B>fi</B> <B>for</B> <B>function</B> <B>if</B> <B>in</B> <B>then</B> <B>until</B> <B>while</B> <B>{</B> <B>}</B><P>
<A NAME="sect8" HREF="#toc8"><H2><B>SHELL</B> <B>GRAMMAR</B></H2></A>
<B>Simple</B> <B>Commands</B><BR>
 A <I>simple</I> <I>command</I> is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by <I>blank</I>-separated words and redirections, and terminated by a <I>control</I> <I>operator</I>. The first word specifies the command to be executed. The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.<P>
The return value of a <I>simple</I> <I>command</I> is its exit status, or 128+<I>n</I> if the command is terminated by signal <I>n</I>.<P>
<B>Pipelines</B><BR>
 A <I>pipeline</I> is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the character <B>|</B>. The format for a pipeline is:<P>
[ ! ] <I>command</I> [ <B>|</B> <I>command2</I> ... ]<P>
The standard output of <I>command</I> is connected to the standard input of <I>command2</I>. This connection is performed before any redirections specified by the command (see <B>REDIRECTION</B> below).<P>
If the reserved word <B>!</B> precedes a pipeline, the exit status of that pipeline is the logical NOT of the exit status of the last command. Otherwise, the status of the pipeline is the exit status of the last command. The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.<P>
Each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process (i.e., in a subshell).<P>
<B>Lists</B><BR>
 A <I>list</I> is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators <B>;</B>, <B>&</B>, <B>&&</B>, or <B>||</B>, and terminated by one of <B>;</B>, <B>&</B>, or <B>&lt;newline&gt;</B>.<P>
Of these list operators, <B>&&</B> and <B>||</B> have equal precendence, followed by <B>;</B> and <B>&,</B> which have equal precedence.<P>
If a command is terminated by the control operator <B>&</B>, the shell executes the command in the <I>background</I> in a subshell. The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0. Commands separated by a <B>;</B> are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in turn. The return status is the exit status of the last command executed.<P>
The control operators <B>&&</B> and <B>||</B> denote AND lists and OR lists, respectively. An AND list has the form<P>
<I>command</I> <B>&&</B> <I>command2</I><P>
<I>command2</I> is executed if, and only if, <I>command</I> returns an exit status of zero.<P>
An OR list has the form<P>
<I>command</I> <B>||</B> <I>command2</I><P>
<I>command2</I> is executed if and only if <I>command</I> returns a nonzero exit status. The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.<P>
<B>Compound</B> <B>Commands</B><BR>
 A <I>compound</I> <I>command</I> is one of the following:<P>
(<I>list</I>) <I>list</I> is executed in a subshell. Variable assignments and builtin commands that affect the shell's environment do not remain in effect after the command completes. The return status is the exit status of <I>list</I>.<P>
{ <I>list</I>; }<BR>
 <I>list</I> is simply executed in the current shell environment. This is known as a <I>group</I> <I>command</I>. The return status is the exit status of <I>list</I>.<P>
<B>for</B> <I>name</I> [ <B>in</B> <I>word</I>; ] <B>do</B> <I>list</I> ; <B>done</B> The list of words following <B>in</B> is expanded, generating a list of items. The variable <I>name</I> is set to each element of this list in turn, and <I>list</I> is executed each time. If the <B>in</B> <I>word</I> is omitted, the <B>for</B> command executes <I>list</I> once for each positional <dl>
<dt>parameter that is set (see <B>PARAMETERS</B> below).<dd>The exit status is the exit status of the last command, or zero if no commands were executed.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>case</B> <I>word</I> <B>in</B> [ <I>pattern</I> [ <B>|</B> <I>pattern</I> ] ... ) <I>list</I> ;; ] ... <B>esac</B><BR>
 A <B>case</B> command first expands <I>word</I>, and tries to match it against each <I>pattern</I> in turn, using the same matching rules as for pathname expansion (see <B>Pathname</B> <B>Expansion</B> below). When a match is found, the corresponding <I>list</I> is executed. After the first match, no subsequent matches are attempted. The exit status is zero if no patterns are matches. Otherwise, it is the exit status of the last command executed in <I>list</I>.<P>
<B>if</B> <I>list</I> <B>then</B> <I>list</I> [ <B>elif</B> <I>list</I> <B>then</B> <I>list</I> ] ... [ <B>else</B> <I>list</I> ] <B>fi</B><BR>
 The <B>if</B> <I>list</I> is executed. If its exit status is zero, the <B>then</B> <I>list</I> is executed. Otherwise, each <B>elif</B> <I>list</I> is executed in turn, and if its exit status is zero, the corresponding <B>then</B> <I>list</I> is executed and the command completes. Otherwise, the <B>else</B> <I>list</I> is executed, if present. The exit status is the exit status of the last command executed, or zero if no condition tested true.<P>
<B>while</B> <I>list</I> <B>do</B> <I>list</I> <B>done</B><BR>
 <B>until</B> <I>list</I> <B>do</B> <I>list</I> <B>done</B><BR>
 The <B>while</B> command continuously executes the <B>do</B> <I>list</I> as long as the last command in <I>list</I> returns an exit status of zero. The <B>until</B> command is identical to the <B>while</B> command, except that the test is negated; the <B>do</B> <I>list</I> is executed as long as the last command in <I>list</I> returns a non-zero exit status. The exit status of the <B>while</B> and <B>until</B> commands is the exit status of the last <B>do</B> <I>list</I> command executed, or zero if none was executed.<P>
[ <B>function</B> ] <I>name</I> () { <I>list</I>; }<BR>
 This defines a function named <I>name</I>. The <I>body</I> of the function is the <I>list</I> of commands between { and }. This list is executed whenever <I>name</I> is specified as the name of a simple command. The exit status of a function is the exit status of the last command executed in the body. (See <B>FUNCTIONS</B> below.)<P>
<A NAME="sect9" HREF="#toc9"><H2><B>COMMENTS</B></H2></A>
In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the <B>-o</B> <B>interactive-comments</B> option to the <B>set</B> builtin is enabled, a word beginning with <B>#</B> causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored. An interactive shell without the <B>-o</B> <B>interac</B><B>tive-comments</B> option enabled does not allow comments.<P>
<A NAME="sect10" HREF="#toc10"><H2><B>QUOTING</B></H2></A>
<I>Quoting</I> is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell. Quoting can be used to disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being recognized as such, and to prevent parameter expansion.<P>
Each of the <I>metacharacters</I> listed above under <B>DEFINITIONS</B> has special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if they are to represent themselves. There are three quoting mechanisms: the <I>escape</I> <I>character</I>, single quotes, and double quotes.<P>
A non-quoted backslash (<B>\</B>) is the <I>escape</I> <I>character</I>. It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of &lt;newline&gt;. If a <B>\</B>&lt;newline&gt; pair appears, and the backslash is not quoted, the <B>\</B>&lt;newline&gt; is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is effectively ignored).<P>
Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes. A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.<P>
Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of <B>$</B>, <B>`</B>, and <B>\</B>. The characters <B>$</B> and <B>`</B> retain their special meaning within double quotes. The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: <B>$</B>, <B>`</B>, <B>&quot;</B>, <B>\</B>, or <B>&lt;newline&gt;</B>. A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash.<P>
The special parameters <B>*</B> and <B>@</B> have special meaning when in double quotes (see <B>PARAMETERS</B> below).<P>
<A NAME="sect11" HREF="#toc11"><H2><B>PARAMETERS</B></H2></A>
A <I>parameter</I> is an entity that stores values, somewhat like a variable in a conventional programming language. It can be a <I>name</I>, a number, or one of the special characters listed below under <B>Special</B> <B>Parameters</B>. For the shell's purposes, a <I>variable</I> is a parameter denoted by a <I>name</I>.<P>
A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value. The null string is a valid value. Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using the <B>unset</B> builtin command (see <B>SHELL</B> <B>BUILTIN</B> <B>COMMANDS</B> below).<P>
A <I>variable</I> may be assigned to by a statement of the form<P>
<I>name</I>=[<I>value</I>]<P>
If <I>value</I> is not given, the variable is assigned the null string. All <I>values</I> undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal. If the variable has its <B>-i</B> attribute set (see <B>declare</B> below in <B>SHELL</B> <B>BUILTIN</B> <B>COM</B><B>MANDS</B>) then <I>value</I> is subject to arithmetic expansion even if the $[...] syntax does not appear. Word splitting is not performed, with the exception of <B>&quot;$@&quot;</B> as explained below under <B>Special</B> <B>Parameters</B>. Pathname expansion is not performed.<P>
<B>Positional</B> <B>Parameters</B><BR>
 A <I>positional</I> <I>parameter</I> is a parameter denoted by one or more digits, other than the single digit 0. Positional parameters are assigned from the shell's arguments when it is invoked, and may be reassigned using the <B>set</B> builtin command. Positional parameters may not be assigned to with assignment statements. The positional parameters are temporarily replaced when a shell function is executed (see <B>FUNCTIONS</B> below).<P>
When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see <B>EXPANSION</B> below).<P>
<B>Special</B> <B>Parameters</B><BR>
 The shell treats several parameters specially. These parameters may only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.<BR>
 <dl>
<dt><B>*</B><dd>Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the <B>IFS</B> special variable. That is, ``<B>$*</B>'' is equivalent to ``<B>$1c$2c...</B>'', where <I>c</I> is the first character of the value of the <B>IFS</B> variable. If <B>IFS</B> is null or unset, the parameters are separated by spaces. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>@</B><dd>Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands as a separate word. That is, `` <B>$@</B>'' is equivalent to ``<B>$1</B>'' ``<B>$2</B>'' ... When there are no positional parameters, ``<B>$@</B>'' and <B>$@</B> expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed). </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>#</B><dd>Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>?</B><dd>Expands to the status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-</B><dd>Expands to the current option flags as specified upon invocation, by the <B>set</B> builtin command, or those set by the shell itself (such as the <B>-i</B> flag). </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>$</B><dd>Expands to the process ID of the shell. In a () subshell, it expands to the process ID of the current shell, not the subshell. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>!</B><dd>Expands to the process ID of the most recently executed background (asynchronous) command. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>0</B><dd>Expands to the name of the shell or shell script. This is set at shell initialization. If <B>bash</B> is invoked with a file of commands, <B>$0</B> is set to the name of that file. Otherwise, it is set to the pathname used to invoke <B>bash</B>, as given by argument zero. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>_</B><dd>Expands to the last argument to the previous command, after expansion. Also set to the full pathname of each command executed and placed in the environment exported to that command.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>Shell</B> <B>Variables</B><BR>
 The following variables are set by the shell:<P>
<dl>
<dt><B>PPID</B><dd>The process ID of the shell's parent. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>PWD</B><dd>The current working directory as set by the <B>cd</B> command. <B>OLDPWD</B> The previous working directory as set by the <B>cd</B><P>
</dd>
</dl>
command.<BR>
 <B>REPLY</B> Set to the line of input read by the <B>read</B> builtin command when no arguments are supplied. <dl>
<dt><B>UID</B><dd>Expands to the user ID of the current user, initialized at shell startup. <B>EUID</B> Expands to the effective user ID of the current user, initialized at shell startup. <B>BASH</B> Expands to the full pathname used to invoke this instance of <B>bash</B>. <B>BASH_VERSION</B> Expands to the version number of this instance of <B>bash</B>. <B>SHLVL</B> Incremented by one each time an instance of <B>bash</B> is started. <B>RANDOM</B> Each time this parameter is referenced, a random integer is generated. The sequence of random numbers may be initialized by assigning a value to <B>RANDOM</B>. If <B>RANDOM</B> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset. <B>SECONDS</B> Each time this parameter is referenced, the number of seconds since shell invocation is returned. If a value is assigned to <B>SECONDS</B>, the value returned upon subsequent references is the number of seconds since the assignment plus the value assigned. If <B>SECONDS</B> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset. <B>LINENO</B> Each time this parameter is referenced, the shell substitutes a decimal number representing the current sequential line number (starting with 1) within a script or function. When not in a script or function, the value substituted is not guaranteed to be meaningful. When in a function, the value is not the number of the source line that the command appears on (that information has been lost by the time the function is executed), but is an approximation of the number of <I>simple</I> <I>commands</I> executed in the current function. If <B>LINENO</B> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset. <B>OPTARG</B> The value of the last option argument processed by the <B>getopts</B> builtin command (see <B>SHELL</B> <B>BUILTIN</B> <B>COM</B><B>MANDS</B> below). <B>OPTIND</B> The index of the last option processed by the <B>getopts</B> builtin command (see <B>SHELL</B> <B>BUILTIN</B> <B>COMMANDS</B> below).<P>
</dd>
</dl>
The following variables are used by the shell. In some cases, <B>bash</B> assigns a default value to a variable; these cases are noted below.<P>
<dl>
<dt><B>IFS</B><dd>The <I>Internal</I> <I>Field</I> <I>Separator</I> that is used for word splitting after expansion and to split lines into words with the <B>read</B> builtin command. The default value is ``&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;''. <B>PATH</B> The search path for commands. It is a colonseparated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands (see <B>COMMAND</B> <B>EXECUTION</B> below). The default path is system-dependent, and is set by the administrator who installs <B>bash</B>. A common </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>value<dd>is ``.:/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin:/etc:/usr/etc''. Note that in some circumstances, however, a leading `.' in <B>PATH</B> can be a security hazard. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>HOME</B><dd>The home directory of the current user; the default argument for the <B>cd</B> builtin command. <B>CDPATH</B> The search path for the <B>cd</B> command. This is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for destination directories specified by the <B>cd</B> command. A sample value is ``.:~:/usr''. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>ENV</B><dd>If this parameter is set when <B>bash</B> is executing a shell script, its value is interpreted as a filename containing commands to initialize the shell, as in <I>.bashrc</I>. The value of <B>ENV</B> is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a pathname. <B>PATH</B> is not used to search for the resultant pathname. <B>MAIL</B> If this parameter is set to a filename and the <B>MAILPATH</B> variable is not set, <B>bash</B> informs the user of the arrival of mail in the specified file. <B>MAILCHECK</B> Specifies how often (in seconds) <B>bash</B> checks for mail. The default is 60 seconds. When it is time to check for mail, the shell does so before prompting. If this variable is unset, the shell disables mail checking. <B>MAILPATH</B> A colon-separated list of pathnames to be checked for mail. The message to be printed may be specified by separating the pathname from the message with a `?'. $_ stands for the name of the current mailfile. Example: </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>MAILPATH</B>='/usr/spool/mail/bfox?"You<dd>have mail":~/shell-mail?"$_ has mail!"' <B>Bash</B> supplies a default value for this variable, but the location of the user mail files that it uses      is      system      dependent      (e.g., /usr/spool/mail/<B>$USER</B>). <B>MAIL_WARNING</B> If set, and a file that <B>bash</B> is checking for mail has been accessed since the last time it was checked, the message ``The mail in <I>mailfile</I> has been read'' is printed. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>PS1</B><dd>The value of this parameter is expanded (see <B>PROMPTING</B> below) and used as the primary prompt string. The default value is ``<B>bash\$</B> `'. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>PS2</B><dd>The value of this parameter is expanded like <B>PS1</B> and used as the secondary prompt string. The default is ``<B>&gt;</B> `'. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>PS4</B><dd>The value of this parameter is expanded like <B>PS1</B> and the value is printed before each command <B>bash</B> displays during an execution trace. The first character of <B>PS4</B> is replicated multiple times, as necessary, to indicate multiple levels of indirection. The default is ``<B>+</B> `'. <B>NO_PROMPT_VARS</B> If set, a decoded prompt string does not undergo further expansion (see <B>PROMPTING</B> below). <B>HISTSIZE</B> The number of commands to remember in the command history (see <B>HISTORY</B> below). The default value is 500. <B>HISTFILE</B> The name of the file in which command history is saved. (See <B>HISTORY</B> below.) The default value is <I>~/.bash_history</I>. If unset, the command history is not saved when an interactive shell exits. <B>HISTFILESIZE</B> The maximum number of lines contained in the history file. When this variable is assigned a value, the history file is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than that number of lines. The default value is 500. <B>OPTERR</B> If set to the value 1, <B>bash</B> displays error messages generated by the <B>getopts</B> builtin command (see <B>SHELL</B> <B>BUILTIN</B> <B>COMMANDS</B> below). <B>OPTERR</B> is initialized to 1 each time the shell is invoked or a shell script is executed. <B>PROMPT_COMMAND</B> If set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary prompt. <B>IGNOREEOF</B> <B>ignoreeof</B> Controls the action of the shell on receipt of an <B>EOF</B> character as the sole input. If set, the value is the number of consecutive <B>EOF</B> characters typed before <B>bash</B> exits. If the variable exists but does not have a numeric value, or has no value, the default value is 10. If it does not exist, <B>EOF</B> signifies the end of input to the shell. This is only in effect for interactive shells. <B>HOSTTYPE</B> Automatically set to a string that uniquely describes the type of machine on which <B>bash</B> is executing. The default is system-dependent. <B>TMOUT</B> If set to a value greater than zero, the value is interpreted as the number of seconds to wait for input after issuing the primary prompt. <B>Bash</B> terminates after waiting for that number of seconds if input does not arrive. <B>FCEDIT</B> The default editor for the <B>fc</B> builtin command.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>FIGNORE</B><BR>
 A colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when performing filename completion (see <B>READLINE</B> below). A filename whose suffix matches one of the entries in <B>FIGNORE</B> is excluded from the list of matched filenames. A sample value is ``.o:~''. <B>notify</B> If set, <B>bash</B> reports terminated background jobs immediately, rather than waiting until before printing the next primary prompt (see also the <B>-b</B> option to the <B>set</B> builtin command). <B>history_control</B><BR>
 If set to a value of <I>ignorespace</I>, lines which begin with a <B>&lt;space&gt;</B> are not entered on the history list. If set to a value of <I>ignoredups</I>, lines matching the last history line are not entered. If unset, or if set to any other value than those above, all lines read by the parser are saved on the history list. <B>command_oriented_history</B><BR>
 If set, <B>bash</B> attempts to save all lines of a multiple-line command in the same history entry. This allows easy re-editing of multi-line commands. <B>glob_dot_filenames</B><BR>
 If set, <B>bash</B> includes filenames beginning with a `.' in the results of pathname expansion. <B>allow_null_glob_expansion</B><BR>
 If set, <B>bash</B> allows pathname patterns which match no files (see <B>Pathname</B> <B>Expansion</B> below) to expand to a null string, rather than themselves. <B>histchars</B><BR>
 The two or three characters which control history expansion and tokenization (see <B>HISTORY</B> <B>EXPANSION</B> below). The first character is the <I>history</I> <I>expan</I><I>sion</I> <I>character</I>, that is, the character which signals the start of a history expansion, normally `<B>!</B>'. The second character is the <I>quick</I> <I>substitu</I><I>tion</I> character, which is used as shorthand for rerunning the previous command entered, substituting one string for another in the command. The default is `<B>^</B>'. The optional third character is the character which signifies that the remainder of the line is a comment, when found as the first character of a word, normally `<B>#</B>'. The history comment character causes history substitution to be skipped for the remaining words on the line. It does not necessarily cause the shell parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment. <B>nolinks</B><BR>
 If set, the shell does not follow symbolic links when executing commands that change the current working directory. It uses the physical directory structure instead. By default, <B>bash</B> follows the logical chain of directories when performing commands such as <B>cd</B>.<P>
<B>hostname_completion_file</B><BR>
 Contains the name of a file in the same format as <I>/etc/hosts</I> that should be read when the shell needs to complete a hostname. You can change the file interactively; the next time you want to complete a hostname <B>bash</B> adds the contents of the new file to the already existing database.<BR>
 <B>noclobber</B><BR>
 If set, <B>bash</B> does not overwrite an existing file with the <B>&gt;</B>, <B>&gt;&</B>, and <B>&lt;&gt;</B> redirection operators. This variable may be overridden when creating output files by using the redirection operator <B>&gt;|</B> instead of <B>&gt;</B> (see also the <B>-C</B> option to the <B>set</B> builtin command).<BR>
 <B>auto_resume</B><BR>
 This variable controls how the shell interacts with the user and job control. If this variable is set, single word simple commands without redirections are treated as candidates for resumption of an existing stopped job. There is no ambiguity allowed; if there is more than one job beginning with the string typed, the job most recently accessed is selected.<BR>
 <B>no_exit_on_failed_exec</B><BR>
 If this variable exists, a non-interactive shell will not exit if it cannot execute the file specified in the <B>exec</B> builtin command. An interactive shell does not exit if <B>exec</B> fails. <B>cdable_vars</B><BR>
 If this is set, an argument to the <B>cd</B> builtin command that is not a directory is assumed to be the name of a variable whose value is the directory to change to.<P>
<A NAME="sect12" HREF="#toc12"><H2><B>EXPANSION</B></H2></A>
Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into words. There are seven kinds of expansion performed: <I>brace</I> <I>expansion</I>, <I>tilde</I> <I>expansion</I>, <I>parameter</I> <I>and</I> <I>variable</I> <I>expansion</I>, <I>command</I> <I>substitution</I>, <I>arithmetic</I> <I>expansion</I>, <I>word</I> <I>splitting</I>, and <I>pathname</I> <I>expansion</I>.<P>
The order of expansions is: brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter, variable, command, and arithmetic substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion), word splitting, and pathname expansion.<P>
On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion available: <I>process</I> <I>substitution</I>.<P>
Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can change the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a single word to a single word. The single exception to this is the expansion of ``<B>$@</B>'' as explained above (see <B>PARAMETERS</B>).<P>
<B>Brace</B> <B>Expansion</B><BR>
 <I>Brace</I> <I>expansion</I> is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated. This mechanism is similar to <I>pathname</I> <I>expansion</I>, but the filenames generated need not exist. Patterns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional <I>preamble</I>, followed by a series of comma-separated strings between a pair of braces, followed by an optional <I>postam</I><I>ble</I>. The preamble is prepended to each string contained within the braces, and the postamble is then appended to each resulting string, expanding left to right.<P>
Brace expansions may be nested. The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left to right order is preserved. For example, a<B>{</B>d,c,b<B>}</B>e expands into `ade ace abe'.<P>
Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result. It is strictly textual. <B>Bash</B> does not apply any syntactic interpretation to the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.<P>
A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma. Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged.<P>
This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:<P>
mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs} or<BR>
 chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}<P>
Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with traditional versions of <B>sh</B>, the Bourne shell. <B>sh</B> does not treat opening or closing braces specially when they appear as part of a word, and preserves them in the output. <B>Bash</B> removes braces from words as a consequence of brace expansion. For example, a word entered to <B>sh</B> as <I>file{1,2}</I> appears identically in the output. The same word is output as <I>file1</I> <I>file2</I> after expansion by <B>bash</B>. If strict compatibility with <B>sh</B> is desired, start <B>bash</B> with the <dl>
<dt><B>-nobraceexpansion</B> flag<dd>(see <B>OPTIONS</B> above) or disable brace expansion with the <B>+o</B> <B>braceexpand</B> option to the <B>set</B> command (see <B>SHELL</B> <B>BUILTIN</B> <B>COMMANDS</B> below).<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>Tilde</B> <B>Expansion</B><BR>
 If a word begins with a tilde character (`<B>~</B>'), all of the characters preceding the first slash (or all characters, if there is no slash) are treated as a possible <I>login</I> <I>name</I>. If this <I>login</I> <I>name</I> is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the parameter <B>HOME</B>. If <B>HOME</B> is unset, the home directory of the user executing the shell is substituted instead.<P>
If a `+' follows the tilde, the value of <B>PWD</B> replaces the tilde and `+'. If a `-' follows, the value of <B>OLDPWD</B> is substituted. If the value following the tilde is a valid <I>login</I> <I>name</I>, the tilde and <I>login</I> <I>name</I> are replaced with the home directory associated with that name. If the name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is unchanged.<P>
Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted instances of tildes following a <B>:</B> or <B>=</B>. In these cases, tilde substitution is also performed. Consequently, one may use pathnames with tildes in assignments to <B>PATH</B>, <B>MAILPATH</B>, and <B>CDPATH</B>, and the shell assigns the expanded value.<P>
<B>Parameter</B> <B>Expansion</B><BR>
 The `<B>$</B>' character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion. The parameter name or symbol to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to protect the variable to be expanded from characters immediately following it which could be interpreted as part of the name.<P>
${<I>parameter</I>}<BR>
 The value of <I>parameter</I> is substituted. The braces are required when <I>parameter</I> is a positional parameter with more than one digit, or when <I>parameter</I> is followed by a character which is not to be interpreted as part of its name.<P>
In each of the cases below, <I>word</I> is subject to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. <B>Bash</B> tests for a parameter that is unset or null; omitting the colon results in a test only for a parameter that is unset.<P>
${<I>parameter:-word</I>}<BR>
 <B>Use</B> <B>Default</B> <B>Values</B>. If <I>parameter</I> is unset or null, the expansion of <I>word</I> is substituted. Otherwise, the value of <I>parameter</I> is substituted. ${<I>parameter:=word</I>}<BR>
 <B>Assign</B> <B>Default</B> <B>Values</B>. If <I>parameter</I> is unset or null, the expansion of <I>word</I> is assigned to <I>parame</I><I>ter</I>. The value of <I>parameter</I> is then substituted. Positional parameters and special parameters may not be assigned to in this way. ${<I>parameter:?word</I>}<BR>
 <B>Display</B> <B>Error</B> <B>if</B> <B>Null</B> <B>or</B> <B>Unset</B>. If <I>parameter</I> is null or unset, the expansion of <I>word</I> (or a message to that effect if <I>word</I> is not present) is written to the standard error and the shell, if it is not interactive, exits.    Otherwise, the value of <I>parameter</I> is substituted.<BR>
 ${<I>parameter:+word</I>}<BR>
 <B>Use</B> <B>Alternate</B> <B>Value</B>. If <I>parameter</I> is null or unset, nothing is substituted, otherwise the expansion of <I>word</I> is substituted.<BR>
 ${<B>#parameter</B>}<BR>
 The length in characters of the value of <I>parameter</I> is substituted. If <I>parameter</I> is <B>*</B> or <B>@</B>, the length substituted is the length of <B>*</B> expanded within double quotes.<BR>
 ${<I>parameter#word</I>}<BR>
 ${<I>parameter##word</I>}<BR>
 The <I>word</I> is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion. If the pattern matches the beginning of the value of <I>parameter</I>, then the expansion is the value of <I>parameter</I> with the shortest matching pattern deleted (the ``<B>#</B>'' case) or the longest matching pattern deleted (the ``<B>##</B>'' case).<P>
${<I>parameter%word</I>}<BR>
 ${<I>parameter%%word</I>}<BR>
 The <I>word</I> is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion. If the pattern matches a trailing portion of the value of <I>parameter</I>, then the expansion is the value of <I>parameter</I> with the shortest matching pattern deleted (the ``<B>%</B>'' case) or the longest matching pattern deleted (the ``<B>%%</B>'' case).<P>
<B>Command</B> <B>Substitution</B><BR>
 <I>Command</I> <I>substitution</I> allows the output of a command to replace the command name. There are two forms:<P>
<B>$(command)</B><BR>
 or<BR>
 <B>`command`</B><P>
<B>Bash</B> performs the expansion by executing <I>command</I> and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted.<P>
When the old-style backquote form of substitution is used, backslash retains its literal meaning except when followed by <B>$</B>, <B>`</B>, or <B>\</B>. When using the $(<I>command</I>) form, all characters between the parentheses make up the command; none are treated specially.<P>
Command substitutions may be nested. To nest when using the old form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.<P>
If the substitution appears within double quotes, word splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the results.<P>
<B>Arithmetic</B> <B>Expansion</B><BR>
 Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and the substitution of the result. The format for arithmetic expansion is:<P>
<B>$[expression]</B><P>
The <I>expression</I> is treated as if it were within double quotes, but a double quote inside the braces is not treated specially. All tokens in the expression undergo parameter expansion, command substitution, and quote removal. Arithmetic substitutions may be nested.<P>
The evaluation is performed according to the rules listed below under <B>ARITHMETIC</B> <B>EVALUATION</B>. If <I>expression</I> is invalid, <B>bash</B> prints a message indicating failure and no substitution occurs.<P>
<B>Process</B> <B>Substitution</B><BR>
 <I>Process</I> <I>substitution</I> is supported on systems that support named pipes (<I>FIFOs</I>) or the <B>/dev/fd</B> method of naming open files. It takes the form of <B>&lt;(list)</B> or <B>&gt;(list)</B>. The process <I>list</I> is run with its input or output connected to a <I>FIFO</I> or some file in <B>/dev/fd</B>. The name of this file is passed as an argument to the current command as the result of the expansion. If the <B>&gt;(list)</B> form is used, writing to the file will provide input for <I>list</I>. If the <B>&lt;(list)</B> form is used, the file passed as an argument should be read to obtain the output of <I>list</I>.<P>
On systems that support it, <I>process</I> <I>substitution</I> is performed simultaneously with <I>parameter</I> <I>and</I> <I>variable</I> <I>expan</I><I>sion</I>, <I>command</I> <I>substitution</I>, and <I>arithmetic</I> <I>expansion</I>.<P>
<B>Word</B> <B>Splitting</B><BR>
 The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double quotes for <I>word</I> <I>splitting</I>.<P>
The shell treats each character of <B>IFS</B> as a delimiter, and splits the results of the other expansions into words on these characters. If the value of <B>IFS</B> is exactly <B>&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;</B>, the default, then any sequence of <B>IFS</B> characters serves to delimit words; otherwise each occurrence of an <B>IFS</B> character is treated as a delimiter. If the value of <B>IFS</B> is null, no word splitting occurs. <B>IFS</B> cannot be unset.<P>
Explicit null arguments (<B>"&quot;</B> or <B>`'</B>) are retained. Implicit null arguments, resulting from the expansion of <I>parameters</I> that have no values, are removed.<P>
Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.<P>
<B>Pathname</B> <B>Expansion</B><BR>
 After word splitting, unless the <B>-f</B> option has been set, <B>bash</B> scans each <I>word</I> for the characters <B>*</B>, <B>?</B>, and <B>[</B>. If one of these characters appears, then the word is regarded as a <I>pattern</I>, and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of pathnames matching the pattern. If no matching pathnames    are    found,    and the shell variable <B>allow_null_glob_expansion</B> is unset, the word is left unchanged. If the variable is set, and no matches are found, the word is removed. When a pattern is used for pathname generation, the character <B>``.''</B> at the start of a name or immediately following a slash must be matched explicitly, unless the shell variable <B>glob_dot_filenames</B> is set. The slash character must always be matched explicitly. In other cases, the <B>``.''</B> character is not treated specially.<P>
The special pattern characters have the following meanings:<P>
<dl>
<dt><B>*</B><dd>Matches any string, including the null string. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>?</B><dd>Matches any single character. <B>[...]</B> Matches any one of the enclosed characters. A pair of characters separated by a minus sign denotes a <I>range</I>; any character lexically between those two characters, inclusive, is matched. If the first character following the <B>[</B> is a <B>!</B> or a <B>^</B> then any character not enclosed is matched. A <B>-</B> or <B>]</B> may be matched by including it as the first or last character in the set.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>Quote</B> <B>Removal</B><BR>
 After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the characters <B>\</B>, <B>`</B>, and <B>&quot;</B> are removed.<P>
<A NAME="sect13" HREF="#toc13"><H2><B>REDIRECTION</B></H2></A>
Before a command is executed, its input and output may be <I>redirected</I> using a special notation interpreted by the shell. Redirection may also be used to open and close files for the current shell execution environment. The following redirection operators may appear anywhere in a <dl>
<dt><I>simple</I> <I>command</I> or may precede or follow a <I>command</I>.<dd>Redirections are processed in the order they appear, from left to right.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is omitted, and the first character of the redirection operator is <B>&lt;</B>, the redirection refers to the standard input (file descriptor 0). If the first character of the redirection operator is <B>&gt;</B>, the redirection refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).<P>
The word that follows the redirection operator in the following descriptions is subjected to brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, quote removal, and pathname expansion. If it expands to more than one word, <B>bash</B> reports an error.<P>
Note that the order of redirections is significant. For example, the command<P>
ls <B>&gt;</B> dirlist 2<B>&gt;&</B>1<P>
directs both standard output and standard error to the file <I>dirlist</I>, while the command<P>
ls 2<B>&gt;&</B>1 <B>&gt;</B> dirlist<P>
directs only the standard output to file <I>dirlist</I>, because the standard error was duplicated as standard output before the standard output was redirected to <I>dirlist</I>.<P>
<B>Redirecting</B> <B>Input</B><BR>
 Redirection of input causes the file whose name results from the expansion of <I>word</I> to be opened for reading on file descriptor <I>n</I>, or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if <I>n</I> is not specified.<P>
The general format for redirecting input is:<P>
[<I>n</I>]<B>&lt;word</B><P>
<B>Redirecting</B> <B>Output</B><BR>
 Redirection of output causes the file whose name results from the expansion of <I>word</I> to be opened for writing on file descriptor <I>n</I>, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if <I>n</I> is not specified. If the file does not exist it is created; if it does exist it is truncated to zero size.<P>
The general format for redirecting output is:<P>
[<I>n</I>]<B>&gt;word</B><P>
If the redirection operator is <B>&gt;|</B>, then the variable <B>noclobber</B> is not consulted, and the file is created regardless of the value of <B>noclobber</B> (see <B>Shell</B> <B>Variables</B> above and the <B>-C</B> option to the <B>set</B> builtin command).<P>
<B>Appending</B> <B>Redirected</B> <B>Output</B><BR>
 Redirection of output in this fashion causes the file whose name results from the expansion of <I>word</I> to be opened for appending on file descriptor <I>n</I>, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if <I>n</I> is not specified. If the file does not exist it is created.<P>
The general format for appending output is:<P>
[<I>n</I>]<B>&gt;&gt;word</B><P>
<B>Redirecting</B> <B>Standard</B> <B>Output</B> <B>and</B> <B>Standard</B> <B>Error</B> <B>Bash</B> allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to be redirected to the file whose name is the expansion of <I>word</I> with this construct.<P>
There are two formats for redirecting standard output and standard error:<P>
<B>&&gt;word</B><BR>
 and<BR>
 <B>&gt;&word</B><P>
Of the two forms, the first is preferred. This is semantically equivalent to<P>
<B>&gt;word</B> 2<B>&gt;&</B>1<P>
<B>Here</B> <B>Documents</B><BR>
 This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the current source until a line containing only <I>word</I> (with no trailing blanks) is seen. All of the lines read up to that point are then used as the standard input for a command.<P>
The format of here-documents is as follows:<P>
<B>&lt;&lt;</B>[<B>-</B>]<I>word</I><BR>
 <I>here-document</I><BR>
 <I>delimiter</I><P>
No parameter expansion, command substitution, pathname expansion, or arithmetic expansion is performed on <I>word</I>. If any characters in <I>word</I> are quoted, the <I>delimiter</I> is the result of quote removal on <I>word</I>, and the lines in the here-document are not expanded. Otherwise, all lines of the here-document are subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. In the latter case, the pair <B>\&lt;newline&gt;</B> is ignored, and <B>\</B> must be used to quote the characters <B>\</B>, <B>$</B>, and <B>`</B>.<P>
If the redirection operator is <B>&lt;&lt;-</B>, then all leading tab characters are stripped from input lines and the line containing <I>delimiter</I>. This allows here-documents within shell scripts to be indented in a natural fashion.<P>
<B>Duplicating</B> <B>File</B> <B>Descriptors</B><BR>
 The redirection operator<P>
[<I>n</I>]<B>&lt;&word</B><P>
is used to duplicate input file descriptors. If <I>word</I> expands to one or more digits, the file descriptor denoted by <I>n</I> is made to be a copy of that file descriptor. If <I>word</I> evaluates to <B>-</B>, file descriptor <I>n</I> is closed. If <I>n</I> is not specified, the standard input (file descriptor 0) is used.<P>
The operator<P>
[<I>n</I>]<B>&gt;&word</B><P>
is used similarly to duplicate output file descriptors. If <I>n</I> is not specified, the standard output (file descriptor 1) is used. As a special case, if <I>n</I> is omitted, and <I>word</I> does not expand to one or more digits, the standard output and standard error are redirected as described previously.<P>
<B>Opening</B> <B>File</B> <B>Descriptors</B> <B>for</B> <B>Reading</B> <B>and</B> <B>Writing</B> The redirection operator<P>
[<I>n</I>]<B>&lt;&gt;word</B><P>
causes the file whose name is the expansion of <I>word</I> to be opened for both reading and writing on file descriptor <I>n</I>, or as the standard input and standard output if <I>n</I> is not specified. If the file does not exist, it is created.<P>
<A NAME="sect14" HREF="#toc14"><H2><B>FUNCTIONS</B></H2></A>
A shell function, defined as described above under <B>SHELL</B> <B>GRAMMAR</B>, stores a series of commands for later execution. Functions are executed in the context of the current shell; no new process is created to interpret them (contrast this with the execution of a shell script). When a function is executed, the arguments to the function become the positional parameters during its execution. The special parameter <B>#</B> is updated to reflect the change. Positional parameter 0 is unchanged.<P>
Variables local to the function may be declared with the <B>local</B> builtin command. Ordinarily, variables and their values are shared between the function and its caller.<P>
If the builtin command <B>return</B> is executed in a function, the function completes and execution resumes with the next command after the function call. When a function completes, the values of the positional parameters and the special parameter <B>#</B> are restored to the values they had prior to function execution.<P>
Function names may be listed with the <B>-f</B> option to the <B>declare</B> or <B>typeset</B> builtin commands. Functions may be exported so that subshells automatically have them defined with the <B>-f</B> option to the <B>export</B> builtin.<P>
Functions may be recursive. No limit is imposed on the number of recursive calls.<P>
<A NAME="sect15" HREF="#toc15"><H2><B>ALIASES</B></H2></A>
The shell maintains a list of <I>aliases</I> that may be set and unset with the <B>alias</B> and <B>unalias</B> builtin commands (see <B>SHELL</B> <B>BUILTIN</B> <B>COMMANDS</B> below). The first word of each command, if unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias. If so, that word is replaced by the text of the alias. The alias name and the replacement text may contain any valid shell input, including the <I>metacharacters</I> listed above. The first word of the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to an <dl>
<dt>alias being expanded is not expanded a second time.<dd>This means that one may alias <B>ls</B> to <B>ls</B> <B>-F</B>, for instance, and <B>bash</B> does not try to recursively expand the replacement text. If the last character of the alias value is a <I>blank</I>, then the next command word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
Aliases are created and listed with the <B>alias</B> command, and removed with the <B>unalias</B> command.<P>
There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text, a la <B>csh</B>. If arguments are needed, a shell function should be used.<P>
Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive.<P>
The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat confusing. <B>Bash</B> always reads at least one complete line of input before executing any of the commands on that line. Aliases are expanded when a command is read, not when it is executed. Therefore, an alias definition appearing on the same line as another command does not take effect until the next line of input is read. This means that the commands following the alias definition on that line are not affected by the new alias. This behavior is also an issue when functions are executed. Aliases are expanded when the function definition is read, not when the function is executed, because a function definition is itself a compound command. As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are not available until after that function is executed. To be safe, always put alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use <B>alias</B> in compound commands.<P>
Note that for almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions.<P>
<A NAME="sect16" HREF="#toc16"><H2><B>JOB</B> <B>CONTROL</B></H2></A>
<I>Job</I> <I>control</I> refers to the ability to selectively stop (<I>suspend</I>) the execution of processes and continue (<I>resume</I>) their execution at a later point. A user typically employs this facility via an interactive interface supplied jointly by the system's terminal driver and <B>bash</B>.<P>
The shell associates a <I>job</I> with each pipeline. It keeps a table of currently executing jobs, which may be listed with the <B>jobs</B> command. When <B>bash</B> starts a job asynchronously (in the <I>background</I>), it prints a line that looks like:<P>
[1] 25647<P>
indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID of the last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647. All of the processes in a single pipeline are members of the same job. <B>Bash</B> uses the <I>job</I> abstraction as the basis for job control.<P>
To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job control, the system maintains the notion of a <I>current</I> <I>terminal</I> <I>process</I> <I>group</I> <I>ID</I>. Members of this process group (processes whose process group ID is equal to the current terminal process group ID) receive keyboard-generated signals such as <B>SIGINT</B>. These processes are said to be in the <I>foreground</I>. <I>Background</I> processes are those whose process group ID differs from the terminal's; such processes are immune to keyboard-generated signals. Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or write to the terminal. Background processes which attempt to read from (write to) the terminal are sent a <B>SIGTTIN</B> <B>(SIGTTOU)</B> signal by the terminal driver, which, unless caught, suspends the process.<P>
If the operating system on which <B>bash</B> is running supports job control, <B>bash</B> allows you to use it. Typing the <I>sus</I><I>pend</I> character (typically <B>^Z</B>, Control-Z) while a process is running causes that process to be stopped and returns you to <B>bash</B>. Typing the <I>delayed</I> <I>suspend</I> character (typically <B>^Y</B>, Control-Y) causes the process to be stopped when it attempts to read input from the terminal, and control to be returned to <B>bash</B>. You may then manipulate the state of this job, using the <B>bg</B> command to continue it in the background, the <B>fg</B> command to continue it in the foreground, or the <B>kill</B> command to kill it. A <B>^Z</B> takes effect immediately, and has the additional side effect of causing pending output and typeahead to be discarded.<P>
There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell. The character <B>%</B> introduces a job name. Job number <I>n</I> may be referred to as <B>%n</B>. A job may also be referred to using a prefix of the name used to start it, or using a substring that appears in its command line. For example, <B>%ce</B> refers to a stopped <B>ce</B> job. If a prefix matches more than one job, <B>bash</B> reports an error. Using <B>%?ce</B>, on the other hand, refers to any job containing the string <B>ce</B> in its command line. If the substring matches more than one job, <B>bash</B> reports an error. The symbols <B>%%</B> and <B>%+</B> refer to the shell's notion of the <I>current</I> <I>job</I>, which is the last job stopped while it was in the foreground. The <I>pre</I><I>vious</I> <I>job</I> may be referenced using <B>%-</B>. In output pertaining to jobs (e.g., the output of the <B>jobs</B> command), the current job is always flagged with a <B>+</B>, and the previous job with a <B>-</B>.<P>
Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground: <B>%1</B> is a synonym for <B>``fg</B> <B>%1''</B>, bringing job 1 from the background into the foreground. Similarly, <B>``%1</B> <B>&''</B> resumes job 1 in the background, equivalent to <B>``bg</B> <B>%1''</B>.<P>
The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state. Normally, <B>bash</B> waits until it is about to print a prompt before reporting changes in a job's status so as to not interrupt any other output. If the variable <B>notify</B> is set, <B>bash</B> reports such changes immediately. (See also the <dl>
<dt><B>-b</B> option to the <B>set</B> builtin command.)<dd><P>
</dd>
</dl>
If you attempt to exit <B>bash</B> while jobs are stopped, the shell prints a message warning you. You may then use the <B>jobs</B> command to inspect their status. If you do this, or try to exit again immediately, you are not warned again, and the stopped jobs are terminated.<P>
<A NAME="sect17" HREF="#toc17"><H2><B>SIGNALS</B></H2></A>
When <B>bash</B> is interactive, it ignores <B>SIGTERM</B> (so that <B>kill</B> <B>0</B> does not kill an interactive shell), and <B>SIGINT</B> is caught and handled (so that the <B>wait</B> builtin is interruptible). In all cases, <B>bash</B> ignores <B>SIGQUIT</B>. If job control is in effect, <B>bash</B> ignores <B>SIGTTIN</B>, <B>SIGTTOU</B>, and <B>SIGTSTP</B>.<P>
Synchronous jobs started by <B>bash</B> have signals set to the values inherited by the shell from its parent. When job control is not in effect, background jobs (jobs started with <B>&</B>) ignore <B>SIGINT</B> and <B>SIGQUIT</B>. Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore the keyboardgenerated job control signals <B>SIGTTIN</B>, <B>SIGTTOU</B>, and <B>SIGT</B><B>STP</B>.<P>
<A NAME="sect18" HREF="#toc18"><H2><B>COMMAND</B> <B>EXECUTION</B></H2></A>
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.<P>
If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it. If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is invoked as described above in <B>FUNCTIONS</B>. If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If a match is found, that builtin is invoked.<P>
If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, <B>bash</B> searches each element of the <B>PATH</B> for a directory containing an executable file by that name. If the search is unsuccessful, the shell prints an error message and returns a nonzero exit status.<P>
If the search is successful, or if the command name contains one or more slashes, the shell executes the named program. Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the remaining arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.<P>
If this execution fails because the file is not in executable format, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a <I>shell</I> <I>script</I>, a file containing shell commands. A subshell is spawned to execute it. This subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a new shell had been invoked to handle the script, with the exception that the locations of commands remembered by the parent (see <B>hash</B> below under <B>SHELL</B> <B>BUILTIN</B> <B>COMMANDS</B>) are retained by the child.<P>
If the program is a file beginning with <B>#!</B>, the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter for the program. The shell executes the specified interpreter on operating systems that do not handle this executable format themselves. The arguments to the interpreter consist of a single optional argument following the interpreter name on the first line of the program, followed by the name of the program, followed by the command arguments, if any.<P>
<A NAME="sect19" HREF="#toc19"><H2><B>ENVIRONMENT</B></H2></A>
When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the <I>environment</I>. This is a list of <I>name</I>-<I>value</I> pairs, of the form <I>name</I>=<I>value</I>.<P>
The shell allows you to manipulate the environment in several ways. On invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for each name found, auto<dl>
<dt>matically marking it for <I>export</I> to child processes.<dd>Executed commands inherit the environment. The <B>export</B> and <B>declare</B> <B>-x</B> commands allow parameters and functions to be added to and deleted from the environment. If the value of a parameter in the environment is modified, the new value becomes part of the environment, replacing the old. The environment inherited by any executed command consists of the shell's initial environment, whose values may be modified in the shell, less any pairs removed by the <B>unset</B> command, plus any additions via the <B>export</B> and <B>declare</B> <B>-x</B> commands.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
The environment for any <I>simple</I> <I>command</I> or function may be augmented temporarily by prefixing it with parameter assignments, as described above in <B>PARAMETERS</B>. These assignment statements affect only the environment seen by that command.<P>
If the <B>-k</B> flag is set (see the <B>set</B> builtin command below), then <I>all</I> parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command, not just those that precede the command name.<P>
When <B>bash</B> invokes an external command, the variable <B>_</B> is set to the full path name of the command and passed to that command in its environment.<P>
<A NAME="sect20" HREF="#toc20"><H2><B>EXIT</B> <B>STATUS</B></H2></A>
For the purposes of the shell, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded. An exit status of zero indicates success. A non-zero exit status indicates failure. When a command terminates on a fatal signal, <B>bash</B> uses the value of 128+<B>signal</B> as the exit status.<P>
<B>Bash</B> itself returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero value. See also the <B>exit</B> builtin command below.<P>
<A NAME="sect21" HREF="#toc21"><H2><B>PROMPTING</B></H2></A>
When executing interactively, <B>bash</B> displays the primary prompt <B>PS1</B> when it is ready to read a command, and the secondary prompt <B>PS2</B> when it needs more input to complete a command. <B>Bash</B> allows these prompt strings to be customized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special characters that are decoded as follows: <dl>
<dt><B>\t</B><dd>the current time in HH:MM:SS format </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>\d</B><dd>the date in &quot;Weekday Month Date&quot; format (e.g., &quot;Tue May 26") </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>\n</B><dd>CRLF </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>\s</B><dd>the name of the shell, the basename of <B>$0</B> (the portion following the final slash) </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>\w</B><dd>the current working directory </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>\W</B><dd>the basename of the current working directory </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>\u</B><dd>the username of the current user </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>\h</B><dd>the hostname </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>\#</B><dd>the command number of this command </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>\!</B><dd>the history number of this command </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>\$</B><dd>if the effective UID is 0, a <B>#</B>, otherwise a <B>$</B> </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>\nnn</B><dd>character code in octal </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>\\</B><dd>a backslash<P>
</dd>
</dl>
After the string is decoded, if the variable <B>NO_PROMPT_VARS</B> is not set, it is expanded via parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and word splitting.<P>
<A NAME="sect22" HREF="#toc22"><H2><B>READLINE</B></H2></A>
This is the library that handles reading input when using an interactive shell, unless the <B>-nolineediting</B> option is given. By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of emacs. A vi-style line editing interface is also available.<P>
In this section, the emacs-style notation is used to denote keystrokes. Control keys are denoted by C-<I>key</I>, e.g., C-n means Control-N. Similarly, <I>meta</I> keys are denoted by M-<I>key</I>, so M-x means Meta-X. (On keyboards without a <I>meta</I> key, M-<I>x</I> means ESC <I>x</I>, i.e., press the Escape key then the <I>x</I> key. This makes ESC the <I>meta</I> <I>pre</I><I>fix</I>. The combination M-C-<I>x</I> means ESC-Control-<I>x</I>, or press the Escape key then hold the Control key while pressing the <I>x</I> key.)<P>
The default key-bindings may be changed with an <I>~/.inputrc</I> <dl>
<dt>file.<dd>Other programs that use this library may add their own commands and bindings.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
For example, placing<P>
M-Control-u: universal-argument<BR>
 or<BR>
 C-Meta-u: universal-argument<BR>
 into the <I>~/.inputrc</I> would make M-C-u execute the readline command <I>universal-argument</I>.<P>
The following symbolic character names are recognized: <I>RUBOUT</I>, <I>DEL</I>, <I>ESC</I>, <I>LFD</I>, <I>NEWLINE</I>, <I>RET</I>, <I>RETURN</I>, <I>SPC</I>, <I>SPACE</I>, and <I>TAB</I>. In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound to a string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a <I>macro</I>). See the readline documentation for a precise definition of the syntax of key bindings.<P>
<B>Bash</B> allows the current readline key bindings to be displayed or modified with the <B>bind</B> builtin command. The editing mode may be switched during interactive use by using the <B>-o</B> option to the <B>set</B> builtin command (see <B>SHELL</B> <B>BUILTIN</B> <B>COMMANDS</B> below).<P>
Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its behavior. A variable may be set in <I>~/inputrc</I> with a statement of the form<P>
<B>set</B> <I>variable-name</I> <I>value</I><P>
Except where noted, readline variables can take the values<P>
<B>On</B> or <B>Off</B>. The variables and their default values are:<P>
<B>horizontal-scroll-mode</B> <B>(Off)</B><BR>
 When set to <B>On</B>, makes readline use a single line for display, scrolling the input horizontally on a screen line when it becomes longer than the screen width rather than wrapping to a new line. <B>editing-mode</B> <B>(emacs)</B><BR>
 Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bindings similar to <I>emacs</I> or <I>vi</I>. <B>editing-mode</B> can be set to either <B>emacs</B> or <B>vi</B>.<BR>
 <B>mark-modified-lines</B> <B>(Off)</B><BR>
 If set to <B>On</B>, history lines that have been modified are displayed with a preceding asterisk (<B>*</B>). <B>prefer-visible-bell</B> <B>(Off)</B><BR>
 If set to <B>On</B>, readline uses a visible bell if one is available rather than simply ringing the terminal bell.<BR>
 <B>comment-begin</B> <B>(``:</B> <B>`')</B><BR>
 The string that is inserted in <B>vi</B> mode when the <B>vi-comment</B> command is executed.<BR>
 <B>meta-flag</B> <B>(Off)</B><BR>
 If set to <B>On</B>, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is, it will not strip the high bit from the characters it reads), regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.<BR>
 <B>convert-meta</B> <B>(On)</B><BR>
 If set to <B>On</B>, readline will convert characters with the eighth bit set to an ascii key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and prepending an escape character (in effect, using escape as the <I>meta</I> <I>pre</I><I>fix</I>).<BR>
 <B>completion-query-items</B> <B>(100)</B><BR>
 This controls when the user is queried about viewing the number of possible completions generated by the <B>possible-completions</B> command. It may be set to any integer value greater than or equal to zero. If the number of possible completions is greater than or equal to the value of this variable, the user is asked whether or not he wishes to view them; otherwise they are simply listed on the terminal.<P>
Readline commands may be given numeric <I>arguments</I>, which normally act as a repeat count. Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the argument that is significant. Passing a negative argument to a command that acts in the forward direction (e.g., <B>kill-line</B>) causes that command to act in a backward direction. Commands whose behavior with arguments deviates from this are noted.<P>
When a command is described as <I>killing</I> text, the text deleted is saved for possible future retrieval (<I>yanking</I>). The killed text is saved in a <I>kill-ring</I>. Consecutive kills cause the text to be accumulated into one unit, which can be yanked all at once. Commands which do not kill text separate the chunks of text on the kill-ring.<P>
The following is a list of the names of the commands and the default key sequences to which they are bound.<P>
<B>Commands</B> <B>for</B> <B>Moving</B><BR>

 Insert the last argument to the previous command (the last word on the previous line). With an argument <I>n</I>, insert the <I>n</I>th word from the previous command (the words in the previous command begin with word 0).

 Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line.<BR>
 <B>backward-kill-line</B><BR>
 Kill backward to the beginning of the line. This is normally unbound.<BR>
 <B>kill-word</B> <B>(M-d)</B><BR>
 Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or if between words, to the end of the next word. Word boundaries are the same as those used by <B>forward-word</B>.<BR>
 <B>backward-kill-word</B> <B>(M-Rubout)</B><BR>
 Kill the word behind the cursor. Word boundaries are the same as those used by <B>backward-word</B>. <B>unix-line-discard</B> <B>(C-u)</B><BR>
 Kill backward from point to the beginning of the line.<BR>
 <B>unix-word-rubout</B> <B>(C-w)</B><BR>
 Kill the word behind the cursor, using white space as a word boundary. The word boundaries are different from backward-kill-word.<BR>
 <B>yank</B> <B>(C-y)</B><BR>
 Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at the cursor.<BR>
 <B>yank-pop</B> <B>(M-y)</B><BR>

 <B>digit-argument</B> <B>(M-0,</B> <B>M-1,</B> <B>...,</B> <B>M--)</B><BR>
 Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start a new argument. M-- starts a negative argument.<BR>
 <B>universal-argument</B><BR>
 Each time this is executed, the argument count is multiplied by four. The argument count is initially one, so executing this function the first time makes the argument count four. By default, this is not bound to a key.<P>

<A NAME="sect23" HREF="#toc23"><H2><B>HISTORY</B></H2></A>
When interactive, the shell provides access to the <I>command</I> <I>history</I>, the list of commands previously typed. The text of the last <B>HISTSIZE</B> commands (default 500) is saved in a history list. The shell stores each command in the history list prior to parameter and variable expansion (see <B>EXPANSION</B> above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to the values of the shell variables <B>com</B><B>mand_oriented_history</B> and <B>history_control</B>. On startup, the history is initialized from the file named by the variable <B>HISTFILE</B> (default <I>~/.bash_history</I>). <B>HISTFILE</B> is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than <B>HISTFILE</B><B>SIZE</B> lines. The builtin command <B>fc</B> (see <B>SHELL</B> <B>BUILTIN</B> <B>COMMANDS</B> below) may be used to list or edit and re-execute a portion of the history list. The <B>history</B> builtin can be used to display the history list and manipulate the history file. When using the command-line editing, search commands are available in each editing mode that provide access to the history list. When an interactive shell exits, the last <B>HISTSIZE</B> lines are copied from the history list to <B>HISTFILE</B>. If <B>HISTFILE</B> is unset, or if the history file is unwritable, the history is not saved.<P>
<A NAME="sect24" HREF="#toc24"><H2><B>HISTORY</B> <B>EXPANSION</B></H2></A>
The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to the history expansion in <B>csh.</B> This section describes what syntax features are available. This feature is enabled by default for interactive shells, and can be disabled using the <B>+H</B> option to the <B>set</B> builtin command (see <B>SHELL</B> <B>BUILTIN</B> <B>COMMANDS</B> below).    Non-interactive shells do not perform history expansion.<P>
History expansion is performed immediately after a complete line is read, before the shell breaks it into words. It takes place in two parts. The first is to determine which line from the previous history to use during substitution. The second is to select portions of that line for inclusion into the current one. The line selected from the previous history is the <I>event</I>, and the portions of that line that are acted upon are <I>words</I>. The line is broken into words in the same fashion as when reading input, so that several <I>metacharacter</I>-separated words surrounded by quotes are considered as one word. Only backslash (<B>\</B>) can quote the history escape character, which is <B>!</B> by default.<P>
The shell allows control of the various characters used by the history expansion mechanism (see the description of <B>histchars</B> above under <B>Shell</B> <B>Variables</B>).<P>
<B>Event</B> <B>Designators</B><BR>

<A NAME="sect25" HREF="#toc25"><H2><B>ARITHMETIC</B> <B>EVALUATION</B></H2></A>
The shell allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated, under certain circumstances (see the <B>let</B> builtin command and <B>Arithmetic</B> <B>Expansion</B>).

Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is performed before the expression is evaluated. The value of a parameter is coerced to a long integer within an expression. A shell variable need not have its integer attribute turned on to be used in an expression.<P>
Operators are evaluated in order of precedence. Subexpressions in parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence rules above.<P>

<B>:</B> [<I>arguments</I>]<BR>
 No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding <I>arguments</I> and performing any specified redirections. A zero exit code is returned.<P>
<B>.</B> <I>filename</I> [<I>arguments</I>]<BR>
 <B>source</B> <I>filename</I> [<I>arguments</I>]<BR>
 Read and execute commands from <I>filename</I> in the current shell environment and return the exit status of the last command executed from <I>filename</I>. If <I>filename</I> does not contain a slash, pathnames in <B>PATH</B> are used to find the directory containing <I>filename</I>. The file searched for in <B>PATH</B> need not be executable. The current directory is searched if no file is found in <B>PATH</B>. If any <I>arguments</I> are supplied, they become the positional parameters when <I>file</I> is executed. Otherwise the positional parameters are unchanged. The return status is the status of the last command exited within the script (0 if no commands are executed), and false if <I>file</I><I>name</I> is not found.<P>
<B>alias</B> [<I>name</I>[=<I>value</I>] ...]<BR>
 <B>Alias</B> with no arguments prints the list of aliases in the form <I>name</I>=<I>value</I> on standard output. When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each <I>name</I> whose <I>value</I> is given. A trailing space in <I>value</I> causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution when the alias is expanded. For each <I>name</I> in the argument list for which no <I>value</I> is supplied, the name and value of the alias is printed. <B>Alias</B> returns true unless a <I>name</I> is given for which no alias has been defined.<P>
<B>bg</B> [<I>jobspec</I>]<BR>
 Place <I>jobspec</I> in the background, as if it had been started with <B>&</B>. If <I>jobspec</I> is not present, the shell's notion of the <I>current</I> <I>job</I> is used. <B>bg</B> <I>job</I><I>spec</I> returns 0 unless run when job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled, if <I>jobspec</I> was not found or started without job control.<P>

 Display current <B>readline</B> key and function bindings, or bind a key sequence to a <B>readline</B> function or macro. The binding syntax accepted is identical to that of <I>.inputrc</I>, but each binding must be passed as a separate argument; e.g., `"\C-x\C-r": re-readinit-file'. Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:<BR>

The return value is 0 unless an unrecognized option is given or an error occurred.<P>
<B>break</B> [<I>n</I>]<BR>
 Exit from within a <B>for</B>, <B>while</B>, or <B>until</B> loop. If <I>n</I> is specified, break <I>n</I> levels. <I>n</I> must be &gt;= 1. If <I>n</I> is greater than the number of enclosing loops, all enclosing loops are exited. The return value is 0 unless the shell is not executing a loop when <B>break</B> is executed.<P>
<B>builtin</B> <I>shell-builtin</I> [<I>arguments</I>]<BR>
 Execute the specified shell builtin, passing it <I>arguments</I>, and return its exit status. This is useful when you wish to define a function whose name is the same as a shell builtin, but need the functionality of the builtin within the function <dl>
<dt>itself.<dd>The <B>cd</B> builtin is commonly redefined this way. The return status is false if <I>shell-builtin</I> is not a shell builtin command.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>cd</B> [<I>dir</I>]<BR>
 Change the current directory to <I>dir</I>. The variable <B>HOME</B> is the default <I>dir</I>. The variable <B>CDPATH</B> defines the search path for the directory containing <I>dir</I>. Alternative directory names are separated by a colon (:). A null directory name in <B>CDPATH</B> is the same as the current directory, i.e., ``<B>.</B>''. If <I>dir</I> begins with a slash (/), then <B>CDPATH</B> is not used. An argument of <B>-</B> is equivalent to <B>$OLDPWD</B>. The return value is true if the directory was successfully changed; false otherwise.<P>
<B>command</B> [<B>-pVv</B>] <I>command</I> [<I>arg</I> ...]<BR>
 Run <I>command</I> with <I>args</I> suppressing the normal shell function lookup. Only builtin commands or commands found in the <B>PATH</B> are executed. If the <B>-p</B> option is given, the search for <I>command</I> is performed using a default value for <B>PATH</B> that is guaranteed to find all of the standard utilities. If either the <B>-V</B> or <dl>
<dt><B>-v</B> option is supplied, a description of <I>command</I><dd>is </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>printed.<dd>The <B>-v</B> option causes a single word indicating the command or pathname used to invoke <I>com</I><I>mand</I> to be printed; the <B>-V</B> option produces a more verbose description. An argument of <B>--</B> disables option checking for the rest of the arguments. If the <B>-V</B> or <B>-v</B> option is supplied, the exit status is 0 if <I>command</I> was found, and 1 if not. If neither option is supplied and an error occurred or <I>command</I> cannot be found, the exit status is 127. Otherwise, the exit status of the <B>command</B> builtin is the exit status of <I>command</I>.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>continue</B> [<I>n</I>]<BR>
 Resume the next iteration of the enclosing <B>for</B>, <B>while</B>, or <B>until</B> loop. If <I>n</I> is specified, resume at the <I>n</I>th enclosing loop. <I>n</I> must be &gt;= 1. If <I>n</I> is greater than the number of enclosing loops, the last enclosing loop (the `top-level' loop) is resumed. The return value is 0 unless the shell is not executing a loop when <B>continue</B> is executed.<P>
<B>declare</B> [<B>-frxi</B>] [<I>name</I>[=<I>value</I>]]<BR>
 <B>typeset</B> [<B>-frxi</B>] [<I>name</I>[=<I>value</I>]]<BR>
 Declare variables and/or give them attributes. If no <I>name</I>s are given, then display the values of variables instead. The options can be used to restrict output to variables with the specified attribute.<BR>
 <dl>

</dd>
</dl>
Using `+' instead of `-' turns off the attribute instead. When used in a function, makes <I>name</I>s local, as with the <B>local</B> command. The return value is 0 unless an illegal option is encountered, an attempt is made to define a function using &quot;-f foo=bar", an attempt is made to turn off readonly status for a readonly variable, or an attempt is made to display a non-existant function with -f.<P>
<B>dirs</B> <B>[-l]</B><BR>
 Display the list of currently remembered directories. Directories are added to the list with the <B>pushd</B> command; the <B>popd</B> command moves back up through the list. The <B>-l</B> option produces a longer listing; the default listing format uses a tilde to denote the home directory. The return value is 0 unless an illegal option is supplied.<P>
<B>echo</B> [<B>-neE</B>] [<I>arg</I> ...]<BR>
 Output the <I>arg</I>s, separated by spaces. The return status is always 0. If <B>-n</B> is specified, the trailing newline is suppressed. If the <B>-e</B> option is given, interpretation of the following backslashescaped characters is enabled.

<B>enable</B> [<B>-n</B>] [<B>-all</B>] [<I>name</I> ...]<BR>
 Enable and disable builtin shell commands. This allows the execution of a disk command which has the same name as a shell builtin without specifying a full pathname. If <B>-n</B> is used, each <I>name</I> is disabled; otherwise, <I>names</I> are enabled. For example, to use the <B>test</B> found in <B>PATH</B> instead of the shell builtin version, type ``enable -n test''. If no arguments are given, a list of all enabled shell builtins is printed. If only <B>-n</B> is supplied, a list of all disabled builtins is printed. If only <dl>
<dt><B>-all</B> is supplied, the<dd>list printed includes all builtins, with an indication of whether or not each is enabled. <B>enable</B> accepts <B>-a</B> as a synonym for </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-all</B>.<dd>The return value is 0 unless a <I>name</I> is not a shell builtin.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>eval</B> [<I>arg</I> ...]<BR>
 The <I>arg</I>s are read and concatenated together into a single command. This command is then read and executed by the shell, and its exit status is returned as the value of the <B>eval</B> command. If there are no <I>args</I>, or only null arguments, <B>eval</B> returns true.<P>
<B>exec</B> [[<B>-</B>] <I>command</I> [<I>arguments</I>]]<BR>
 If <I>command</I> is specified, it replaces the shell. No new process is created. The <I>arguments</I> become the arguments to <I>command</I>. If the first argument is <B>-</B>, the shell places a dash in the zeroth arg passed to <I>command</I>. This is what login does. If the file cannot be executed for some reason, a noninteractive shell exits, unless the shell variable <B>no_exit_on_failed_exec</B> exists, in which case it returns failure. An interactive shell returns failure if the file cannot be executed. If <I>command</I> is not specified, any redirections take effect in the current shell, and the return status is 0.<P>
<B>exit</B> [<I>n</I>]<BR>
 <B>bye</B> [<I>n</I>]<BR>
 Cause the shell to exit with a status of <I>n</I>. If <I>n</I> is omitted, the exit status is that of the last command executed. A trap on <B>EXIT</B> is executed before the shell terminates.<P>
<B>export</B> [<B>-nf</B>] [<I>name</I>[=<I>word</I>]] ...<BR>
 <B>export</B> <B>-p</B><BR>
 The supplied <I>names</I> are marked for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands. If the <B>-f</B> option is given, the <I>names</I> refer to functions. If no <I>names</I> are given, or if the <B>-p</B> option is supplied, a list of all names that are exported in this shell is printed. The <B>-n</B> option causes the export property to be removed from the named variables. An argument of <B>--</B> disables option checking for the rest of the arguments. <B>export</B> returns an exit status of true unless an illegal option is encountered or <B>-f</B> is supplied with a <I>name</I> that is not a function.<P>
<B>fc</B> [<B>-e</B> <I>ename</I>] [<B>-nlr</B>] [<I>first</I>] [<I>last</I>]<BR>
 <B>fc</B> <B>-s</B> [<I>pat</I>=<I>rep</I>] [<I>cmd</I>]<BR>
 Fix Command. In the first form, a range of commands from <I>first</I> to <I>last</I> is selected from the history list. <I>First</I> and <I>last</I> may be specified as a string (to locate the last command beginning with that string) or as a number (an index into the history list, where a negative number is used as an offset from the current command number). If <I>last</I> is not specified it is set to the current command for listing (so that <B>fc</B> <B>-l</B> <B>-10</B> prints the last 10 commands) and to <I>first</I> otherwise. If <I>first</I> is not specified it is set to the previous command for editing and -16 for listing.<P>
The <B>-n</B> flag suppresses the command numbers when listing. The <B>-r</B> flag reverses the order of the commands. If the <B>-l</B> flag is given, the commands are listed on standard output. Otherwise, the editor given by <I>ename</I> is invoked on a file containing those commands. If <I>ename</I> is not given, the value of the <B>FCEDIT</B> variable is used, and the value of <B>EDITOR</B> if <B>FCEDIT</B> is not set. If neither variable is set, <I>vi</I> is used. When editing is complete, the edited commands are echoed and executed.<P>
In the second form, the command is re-executed after the substitution <I>old</I>=<I>new</I> is performed. A useful alias to use with this is ``r=fc -s'', so that typing ``r cc'' runs the last command beginning with ``cc'' and typing ``r'' re-executes the last command.<P>
If the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an illegal option is encountered or <I>first</I> or <I>last</I> specify history lines out of range. If the <B>-e</B> option is supplied, the return value is the value of the last command executed or failure if an error occurs with the temporary file of commands. If the second form is used, the return status is that of the command re-executed, unless <I>cmd</I> does not specify a valid history line, in which case <B>fc</B> returns failure.<P>
<B>fg</B> [<I>jobspec</I>]<BR>
 Place <I>jobspec</I> in the foreground, and make it the current job. If <I>jobspec</I> is not present, the shell's notion of the <I>current</I> <I>job</I> is used. The return value is that of the command placed into the foreground, or failure if run when job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled, if <I>jobspec</I> does not specify a valid job or <I>jobspec</I> specifies a job that was started without job control.<P>
<B>getopts</B> <I>optstring</I> <I>name</I> [<I>args</I>]<BR>
 <B>getopts</B> is used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters. <I>optstring</I> contains the option letters to be recognized; if a letter is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an argument, which should be separated from it by white space. Each time it is invoked, <B>getopts</B> places the next option in the shell variable <I>name</I>, initializing <I>name</I> if it does not exist, and the index of the next argument to be processed into the variable <B>OPTIND</B>. <B>OPTIND</B> is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell script is invoked. When an option requires an argument, <B>getopts</B> places that argument into the variable <B>OPTARG</B>. The shell does not reset <B>OPTIND</B> automatically; it must be manually reset between multiple calls to <B>getopts</B> within the same shell invocation if a new set of parameters is to be used.<P>
<B>getopts</B> can report errors in two ways. If the first character of <I>optstring</I> is a colon, <I>silent</I> error reporting is used. In normal operation diagnostic messages are printed when illegal options or missing option arguments are encountered. If the variable <B>OPTERR</B> is set to 0, no error message will be displayed, even if the first character of <I>opt</I><I>string</I> is not a colon.<P>
If an illegal option is seen, <B>getopts</B> places ? into <I>name</I> and, if not silent, prints an error message and unsets <B>OPTARG</B>. If <B>getopts</B> is silent, the option character found is placed in <B>OPTARG</B> and no diagnostic message is printed.<P>
If a required argument is not found, and <B>getopts</B> is not silent, a question mark (<B>?</B>) is placed in <I>name</I>, <B>OPTARG</B> is unset, and a diagnostic message is printed. If <B>getopts</B> is silent, then a colon (<B>:</B>) is placed in <I>name</I> and <B>OPTARG</B> is set to the option character found.<P>
<B>getopts</B> normally parses the positional parameters, but if more arguments are given in <I>args</I>, <B>getopts</B> parses those instead. <B>getopts</B> returns true if an option, specified or unspecified, is found. It returns false if the end of options is encountered or an error occurs.<P>
<B>hash</B> [<B>-r</B>] [<I>name</I>]<BR>
 For each <I>name</I>, the full pathname of the command is determined and remembered. The <B>-r</B> option causes the shell to forget all remembered locations. If no arguments are given, information about remembered commands is printed. An argument of <B>-</B>disables option checking for the rest of the arguments. The return status is true unless a <I>name</I> is not found or an illegal option is supplied.<P>
<B>help</B> [<I>pattern</I>]<BR>
 Display helpful information about builtin commands. If <I>pattern</I> is specified, <B>help</B> gives detailed help on all commands matching <I>pattern</I>; otherwise a list of the builtins is printed. The return status is 0 unless no command matches <I>pattern</I>.<P>
<B>history</B> [<I>n</I>]<BR>
 <B>history</B> <B>-rwan</B> [<I>filename</I>]<BR>
 With no options, display the command history list with line numbers. Lines listed with with a <B>*</B> have been modified. An argument of <I>n</I> lists only the last <I>n</I> lines. If a non-option argument is supplied, it is used as the name of the history file; if not, the value of <B>HISTFILE</B> is used. Options, if supplied, have the following meanings: <dl>
<dt><B>-a</B><dd>Append the ``new'' history lines (history lines entered since the beginning of the current bash session) to the history file </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-n</B><dd>Read the history lines not already read from the history file into the current history </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>list.<dd>These are lines appended to the history file since the beginning of the current bash session. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-r</B><dd>read the contents of the history file and use them as the current history </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-w</B><dd>write the current history to the history file, overwriting the history file's contents.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
The return value is 0 unless an illegal option is encountered or an error occurs while reading or writing the history file.<P>
<B>jobs</B> [<B>-lnp</B>] [ <I>jobspec</I> ... ]<BR>
 <B>jobs</B> <B>-x</B> <I>command</I> [ <I>args</I> ... ]<BR>
 The first form lists the active jobs. The <B>-l</B> option lists process IDs in addition to the normal information; the <B>-p</B> option lists only the process ID of the job's process group leader. The <B>-n</B> option displays only jobs that have changed status since last notfied. If <I>jobspec</I> is given, output is restricted to information about that job. The return status is 0 unless an illegal option is encountered or an illegal <I>jobspec</I> is supplied.<P>
If the <B>-x</B> option is supplied, <B>jobs</B> replaces any <I>jobspec</I> found in <I>command</I> or <I>args</I> with the corresponding process group ID, and executes <I>command</I> passing it <I>args</I>, returning its exit status.<P>
<B>kill</B> [<B>-s</B> <B>sigspec</B> | <B>-sigspec</B>] [<I>pid</I> | <I>jobspec</I>] ... <B>kill</B> <B>-l</B> [<I>signum</I>]<BR>
 Send the signal named by <I>sigspec</I> to the processes named by <I>pid</I> or <I>jobspec</I>. <I>sigspec</I> is either a signal name such as <B>SIGKILL</B> or a signal number. If <I>sigspec</I> is a signal name, the name is case insensitive and may be given with or without the <B>SIG</B> prefix. If <I>sigspec</I> is not present, then <B>SIGTERM</B> is assumed. An argument of <B>-l</B> lists the signal names. If any arguments are supplied when <B>-l</B> is given, the names of the specified signals are listed, and the return status is 0. An argument of <B>--</B> disables option checking for the rest of the arguments. <B>kill</B> returns true if at least one signal was successfully sent, or false if an error occurs or an illegal option is encountered.<P>
<B>let</B> <I>arg</I> [<I>arg</I> ...]<BR>
 Each <I>arg</I> is an arithmetic expression to be evaluated (see <B>ARITHMETIC</B> <B>EVALUATION</B>). If the last <I>arg</I> evaluates to 0, <B>let</B> returns 1; 0 is returned otherwise.<P>
<B>local</B> [<I>name</I>[=<I>value</I>]]<BR>
 Create a local variable named <I>name</I>, and assign it <I>value</I>. When <B>local</B> is used within a function, it causes the variable <I>name</I> to have a visible scope restricted to that function and its children. With no operands, <B>local</B> writes a list of local variables to the standard output. It is an error to use <B>local</B> when not within a function. The return status is 0 unless <B>local</B> is used outside a function, or an illegal <I>name</I> is supplied.<P>
<B>logout</B> Exit a login shell.<P>
<B>popd</B> [<B>+/-n</B>]<BR>
 Removes entries from the directory stack. With no arguments, removes the top directory from the stack, and performs a <B>cd</B> to the new top directory. <dl>
<dt><B>+n</B><dd>removes the <I>n</I>th entry counting from the left of the list shown by <B>dirs</B>, starting with zero. For example: ``popd +0'' removes the first directory, ``popd +1'' the second. </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-n</B><dd>removes the <I>n</I>th entry counting from the right of the list shown by <B>dirs</B>, starting with zero. For example: ``popd -0'' removes the last directory, ``popd -1'' the next to last.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
If the <B>popd</B> command is successful, a <B>dirs</B> is performed as well, and the return status is 0. <B>popd</B> returns false if an illegal option is encountered, the directory stack is empty, a non-existant directory stack entry is specified, or the directory change fails.<P>
<B>pushd</B> <I>dir</I><BR>
 <B>pushd</B> <B>+/-n</B><BR>
 Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack, or rotates the stack, making the new top of the stack the current working directory. With no arguments, exchanges the top two directories and returns 0, unless the directory stack is empty. <dl>
<dt><B>+n</B><dd>Rotates the stack so that the <I>n</I>th directory (counting from the left of the list shown by <B>dirs</B>) is at the top. </dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>dir</B><dd>adds <I>dir</I> to the directory stack at the top, making it the new current working directory.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
If the <B>pushd</B> command is successful, a <B>dirs</B> is performed as well. If the first form is used, <B>pushd</B> returns 0 unless the cd to <I>dir</I> fails. With the second form, <B>pushd</B> returns 0 unless the directory stack is empty, a non-existant directory stack element is specified, or the directory change to the specified new current directory fails.<P>
<dl>
<dt><B>pwd</B><dd>Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory. The path printed contains no symbolic links (but see the description of <B>nolinks</B> under <B>Shell</B> <B>Variables</B> above). The return status is 0 unless an error occurs while reading the pathname of the current directory.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>read</B> [<B>-r</B>] [<I>name</I> ...]<BR>
 One line is read from the standard input, and the first word is assigned to the first <I>name</I>, the second word to the second <I>name</I>, and so on, with leftover words assigned to the last <I>name</I>. Only the characters in <B>IFS</B> are recognized as word delim<dl>
<dt>iters.<dd>If no <I>names</I> are supplied, the line read is assigned to the variable <B>REPLY</B>. The return code is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered. If the <B>-r</B> option is given, a backslash-newline pair is not ignored, and the backslash is considered to be part of the line.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>readonly</B> [<B>-f</B>] [<I>name</I> ...]<BR>
 <B>readonly</B> <B>-p</B><BR>
 The given <I>names</I> are marked readonly and the values of these <I>names</I> may not be changed by subsequent assignment. If the <B>-f</B> option is supplied, the functions corresponding to the <I>names</I> are so marked. If no arguments are given, or if the <B>-p</B> option is supplied, a list of all readonly names is printed.<P>
An argument of <B>--</B> disables option checking for the rest of the arguments. The return status is 0 unless an illegal option is encountered or <B>-f</B> is supplied with a <I>name</I> that is not a function.<P>
<B>return</B> [<I>n</I>]<BR>
 Causes a function to exit with the return value specified by <I>n</I>. If <I>n</I> is omitted, the return status is that of the last command executed in the function body. If used outside a function, but during execution of a script by the <B>.</B> (<B>source</B>) command, it causes the shell to stop executing that script and return either <I>n</I> or the exit status of the last command executed within the script as the exit status of the script. If used outside a function and not during execution of a script by <B>.</B>, the return status is false.<P>

The <B>-l</B> option causes the shell to print a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers. An argument of <B>-</B>disables option checking for the rest of the arguments. Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset. Trapped signals are reset to their original values in a child process when it is created.

If the name is not found, then nothing is printed, and an exit status of false is returned. If the <B>-path</B> flag is used, <B>type</B> either returns the name of the disk file that would be executed if <I>name</I> were specified as a command name, or nothing if <B>-type</B> would not return <I>file</I>. If a command is hashed, <B>-path</B> prints the hashed value, not necessarily the file that appears first in <B>PATH</B>. If the <B>-all</B> flag is used, <B>type</B> prints all of the places that contain an executable named <I>name</I>. This includes aliases and functions, if and only if the <B>-path</B> flag is not also used. The table of hashed commands is not consulted when using <B>-all</B>. <B>type</B> accepts <B>-a</B>, <B>-t</B>, and <B>-p</B> in place of <B>-all</B>, <B>-type</B>, and <B>-path</B>, respectively. An argument of <B>--</B> disables option checking for the rest of the arguments. <B>type</B> returns true if any of the arguments are found, false if none are found.<P>

<B>ulimit</B> [<B>-SHacdfmstpn</B> [<I>limit</I>]]<BR>
 <B>Ulimit</B> provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on systems that allow such control. The value of <I>limit</I> can be a number in the unit specified for the resource, or the value <B>unlimited</B>. The <B>H</B> and <B>S</B> options specify that the hard or soft limit is set for the given resource. A hard limit cannot be increased once it is set; a soft limit may be increased up to the value of the hard limit. If neither <B>H</B> nor <B>S</B> is specified, the command applies to the soft limit. If <I>limit</I> is omitted, the current value of the soft limit of the resource is printed, unless the <B>H</B> option is given. When more than one resource is specified, the limit name and unit is printed before the value. Other options are interpreted as follows:<BR>
 <dl>
<dt><B>-a</B><dd>all current limits are reported </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-c</B><dd>the maximum size of core files created </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-d</B><dd>the maximum size of a process's data segment </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-f</B><dd>the maximum size of files created by the shell </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-m</B><dd>the maximum resident set size </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-s</B><dd>the maximum stack size<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-t</B><dd>the maximum amount of cpu time in seconds </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-p</B><dd>the pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set) </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-n</B><dd>the maximum number of open file descriptors (most systems do not allow this value to be set, only displayed) </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-u</B><dd>the maximum number of processes available to a single user </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><B>-v</B><dd>The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the shell<P>
</dd>
</dl>
An argument of <B>--</B> disables option checking for the rest of the arguments. If <I>limit</I> is given, it is the new value of the specified resource (the <B>-a</B> option is display only). If no option is given, then <B>-f</B> is assumed. Values are in 1024-byte increments, except for <B>-t</B>, which is in seconds, and <B>-p</B>, which is in units of 512-byte blocks. The return status is 0 unless an illegal option is encountered, a non-numeric argument other than <B>unlimited</B> is supplied as <I>limit</I>, or an error occurs while setting a new limit.<P>
<B>umask</B> [<B>-S</B>] [<I>mode</I>]<BR>
 The user file-creation mask is set to <I>mode</I>. If <I>mode</I> begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number; otherwise it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar to that accepted by <dl>
<dt><A HREF=chmod.1.html>chmod(1)</A>.<dd>If <I>mode</I> is omitted, or if the <B>-S</B> option is supplied, the current value of the mask is printed. The <B>-S</B> option causes the mask to be printed in symbolic form; the default output is an octal number. An argument of <B>--</B> disables option checking for the rest of the arguments. The return status is 0 if the mode was successfully changed or if no <I>mode</I> argument was supplied, and false otherwise.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>unalias</B> [<I>name</I> ...]<BR>
 Remove <I>name</I>s from the list of defined aliases. The return value is true unless a supplied <I>name</I> is not a defined alias.<P>
<B>unset</B> [-<B>fv</B>] [<I>name</I> ...]<BR>
 For each <I>name</I>, remove the corresponding variable or, given the <B>-f</B> option, function. An argument of <dl>
<dt><B>--</B><dd>disables option checking for the rest of the arguments. Note that <B>PATH</B>, <B>IFS</B>, <B>PPID</B>, <B>PS1</B>, <B>PS2</B>, <B>UID</B>, and <B>EUID</B> cannot be unset. If any of <B>RANDOM</B>, <B>SECONDS</B>, or <B>LINENO</B> are unset, they lose their special properties, even if they are subsequently reset. The exit status is true unless a <I>name</I> does not exist or is non-unsettable.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<B>wait</B> [<I>n</I>]<BR>
 Wait for the specified process and return its termination status. <I>n</I> may be a process ID or a job specification; if a job spec is given, all processes in that job's pipeline are waited for. If <I>n</I> is not given, all currently active child processes <dl>
<dt>are waited for, and the return status is zero.<dd>If <I>n</I> specifies a non-existant process or job, the return status is 127. Otherwise, the return status is the exit status of the last process or job waited for.<P>
</dd>

If you find a bug in <B>bash,</B> you should report it. But first, you should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in the latest version of <B>bash</B> that you have.<P>
Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, mail a bug report to <I>bash-maintainers</I>@<I>ai.MIT.Edu</I>. If you have a fix, you are welcome to mail that as well! Suggestions and `philosophical' bug reports may be mailed to <I>bug</I><I>bash</I>@<I>ai.MIT.Edu</I> or posted to the Usenet newsgroup <B>gnu.bash.bug</B>.<P>
ALL bug reports should include:<P>
The version number of <B>bash</B><BR>
 The hardware and operating system<BR>
 The compiler used to compile<BR>
 A description of the bug behaviour<BR>
 A short script or `recipe' which exercises the bug<P>
Comments and bug reports concerning this manual page should be directed to <I>chet@ins.CWRU.Edu</I>.<P>
<A NAME="sect32" HREF="#toc32"><H2><B>BUGS</B></H2></A>
It's too big and too slow.<P>
There are some subtle differences between <B>bash</B> and traditional versions of <B>sh</B>, mostly because of the <B>POSIX</B> specification.<P>
Aliases are confusing in some uses.<P><HR>
