<h1>
JDE Tutorial</h1>
This tutorial will walk you though the process of creating and running
a program using emacs and the Java Development Environment (JDE). The first
thing to do is run emacs. If you are at a work station open a teminal and
type:
<pre><tt>emacs &amp;</tt></pre>
If you are working elsewhere using telnet type the following:
<pre><tt>TERM=vt100
emacs -nw</tt></pre>
Each action you can take in emacs can be done by typing at the keyboard
or often by use of menus. Both options will be discussed in the tutorial.
Keyboard commands will often have special notation:
<table>
<tr>
<td><tt>C-x</tt></td>

<td>Indicates that you should hold down the Control (Ctrl) key while pressing
the x.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>M-x</tt></td>

<td>Indicates that you should press the Meta key with the x. This can be
done in two ways. Either press and hold the diamond key (on either side
of the space bar on a sun) while pressing the x or press the Escape (Esc)
key release it and then press the x.</td>
</tr>
</table>
A sequence of commands starting with a control or meta key will appear
in the last line of the emacs window which is called the minibuffer.
<b>Important:</b>
anytime you find yourself typing in the minibuffer when you would rather
not be, type C-g (control g) to "quit" the minibuffer. You may need to
do this more than once.
<p>Text listed with a&nbsp;<span class="doThis">blue background</span>
indicates text you should type in emacs. These will indicate the keyboard
method for executing commands. A description of the mouse/menu method will
appear nearby.
<p>The big window in emacs is called the buffer. It is where you edit your
files. Each file you have open will have its own buffer.
<hr><!-- making a new file -->
<h2>
Creating and Opening a file</h2>
The first step to writing a program is creating a file. You can create
an empty file or open an existing file using the command sequence
<tt>C-x
C-f</tt> (remember that is a Control x followed by a Control f). There
will be a line in the minibuffer asking you to type a name for this file.
If the file name exists the file will be opened. Otherwise, a new blank
buffer will be opened with that filename. The file will not be created
until you save (see below).
<h2>
Creating a file with JDE</h2>
For the purposes of this tutorial we will use a slightly different command.
We want JDE to build an outline of our program for use. So we will use
the following command:
<p>
<tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">M-x jde-gen-console-buffer</span></tt>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Before continuing let's break this command down into its component parts:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<tt>M-x</tt></dt>

<dd>
Either the diamond with the x key or escape followed by the x key. This
will put your cursor into the minibuffer. This tells emacs you are about
to give it a command.</dd>

<dt>
<tt>jde-gen-console-buffer</tt></dt>

<dd>
You will type this command directly into the minibuffer and press the return
key. A bit wordy. Read on.</dd>
</dl>
If you are fortunate enough to be using emacs directly on a workstation
i.e. you did not telnet from off site, then you can use your mouse instead.
Just go to the Files menu select the JDE-New sub-menu and choose Console...
We will indicate this action with the notation Files-> JDE New-> Console...<p>Once you have executed the command you will type the name of your new
program in the minibuffer. Type&nbsp;<span class="doThis">Hello.java</span>
in the minibuffer and hit&nbsp;<span class="doThis">return</span>. You
should have in your emacs window something that looks like this: (your
colors may be different or non-existent depending on how you started emacs)
<hr>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
}&nbsp;<span class="comment">// Hello
</span></pre>

<hr><!-- Editing -->Let's make some changes to the file. Above the minibuffer
is an inverse video status line which includes the name of the file you
are editing and some various other information. One piece of information
is the current line number--the line in your file where the cursor is currently
located. You can either use the arrow keys or the mouse to move this cursor.
Put the cursor on line 18 of Hello.java. That should be the blank line directly
below <tt>public static void main(String[] args){</tt>. Type the following:
<pre>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="doThis">System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;)&nbsp;&nbsp; //a line with an error</tt></span></pre>
Line the 'S' in System up with the 'i' in public of the previous line--this
is not a requirement, but it is considered good programming style. You can do
this by pressing <span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">Tab</span> anywhere on
the line.&nbsp; Notice
that there is no semi-colon at the end of the line. This will cause a problem
with the Java compiler. We want it to.
<p>
<hr><!-- Saving -->
<h2>
Saving</h2>
Look again at the status bar at the bottom of emacs. Notice the left end
looks like <tt>--\**</tt>. The stars indicate that this file is in need
of saving. To save the contents of this buffer to the current filename
type <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-x C-s</span></tt>. If you wanted to change the file name (Save As...)
you would type <tt>C-x C-w</tt> and type in a new name. You could perform
these tasks similarly with a mouse by using the menus Files-> Save Buffer
and Files-> Save Buffer As...
<hr><!--Opening a file. -->
<h2>
Recalling or Reopening a Previously Created File</h2>
Suppose you are working on Hello.java and you want to take a break (see Quitting
below). So you leave emacs and log out of your work station and leave.
When you come back and restart emacs, you only need to open the file you
were working on. If you are simply working on a file that already exists
you can type <tt>C-x C-f</tt> or use the menus Files-> Open File... This
will prompt you for a file name in the minibuffer. Try it:
<ul>
<li>
Quit emacs by typing <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-x C-c</span></tt>.</li>

<li>
Take a break. Don't forget to come back.</li>

<li>
Run emacs again (see above).</li>

<li>
Type <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-x C-f</span></tt>.</li>

<li>
Type <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">Hello.java</span></tt> in the minibuffer, and press the <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">return</span></tt>
key.</li>
</ul>
Emacs now has Hello.java in an open buffer, ready for you to continue.
<hr><!-- Compiling w/ errors. -->
<h2>
Compiling and Fixing Errors</h2>
Now we want to compile the file Hello.java. So we will tell emacs to run the
java compiler. We can do this by typing
<tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-c C-v C-c</span></tt> or by selecting
the menu JDE-> Compile. This action will split our window into two separate
buffers. In the top you will see Hello.java. In the bottom you will see the
results of the compilation which should look something like this:
<hr>
<pre>cd c:/My Documents/java/
javac&nbsp; -g Hello.java
<span class="warning">Hello</span><span class="warning">.java</span>:<span class="variable-name">18</span>: ';' expected
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;)&nbsp; //a line with an error
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^
1 error

Compilation exited abnormally with code 1 at Wed Jan 10 14:13:08</pre>
This shows us one error message. Each error message tells us the file name
where the error is, what line number it occurs in, a description of the
error and the line itself. A ^ symbol beneath the line indicates where
the compiler thinks the error occurred.<!-- Fixing errors. -->
<p>Now we have two buffers showing us information. To switch between them
we can either click with the mouse or type <tt>C-x o</tt> to move the cursor
to the other buffer. We'll try this out later.
<p>With JDE you can use the error messages to go directly to the line where
the error occurred. Use one of the following options to do this.
<ul>
<li>
Type <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-x `</span></tt> while the cursor is in the buffer containing Hello.java.
This will advance the cursor to the next error. Doing this multiple times
will go through multiple errors if they exist.</li>

<li>
<b>OR</b> Click on the filename:line part of the error message using the
middle mouse button.</li>

<li>
<b>OR</b> Move the cursor to the buffer containing the error messages.
Put the cursor at the beginning of the error message and press the return
key.</li>
</ul>
Fix the error in Hello.java by adding a semicolon <span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">;</span>
after the ) of line 18.
It should now read:
<pre><tt>System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);&nbsp; //a line with an error</tt></pre>
Recompile Hello.java with <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-c C-v C-c</span></tt>. There will be a question in the
minibuffer asking if you want to save your changes to the file. Type
<tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">y</span></tt>.
<h3>
Working with multiple buffers</h3>
Before going any further let's look at using multiple buffers. The area
containing a buffer is called a window. Currently you should have two visible
windows in emacs. We already saw how <tt>C-x o</tt> switches the cursor
between windows. There are a number of other useful commands for multiple
windows. Below are descriptions of each and how to perform them using either
the keyboard or the mouse.
<table BORDER >
<tr>
<th>Description</th>

<th>Keyboard</th>

<th>Mouse</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Move the cursor to a different window.</td>

<td><tt>C-x o</tt></td>

<td>Click in the window where you want the cursor</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Go back to a single window.</td>

<td><tt>C-x 1</tt></td>

<td>Select from the menus Files-> One Window</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Split one window into two.</td>

<td><tt>C-x 2</tt></td>

<td>Menu: Files-> Split Window</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can also have multiple buffers open at once and they don't all have
to be displayed in emacs. Below are some actions for looking at other buffers.
<table BORDER >
<tr>
<th>Description</th>

<th>Keyboard</th>

<th>Mouse</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Show all open buffers.</td>

<td><tt>C-x C-b</tt></td>

<td>Buffers-> List All Buffers. The Buffers menu has list list of the buffers
you have used most recently.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Switch to a buffer from the list of all buffers.</td>

<td>Move the cursor to the buffer name. Hit return.</td>

<td>Click with the middle button on the name of the buffer.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Switch to a buffer without looking at the list.</td>

<td><tt>C-x b</tt> The name shown in the minibuffer is the default. To
switch to it press return, otherwise type the name of the buffer you wish
to switch to.</td>

<td>Select the name of a buffer from those in the Buffers menu</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Try it: Manipulating Buffers
<ul>
<li>
Move the cursor to the window containing the compilation messages. <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-x
o</span></tt>.</li>

<li>
Show only this buffer. <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-x 1</span></tt></li>

<li>
Switch to the scratch buffer. <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-x b</span></tt> type <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">*scratch*</span></tt> and
hit&nbsp;<span class="doThis">return</span>.</li>

<li>
Split the window. <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-x 2</span></tt></li>

<li>
Move the cursor to the bottom window. <span style="background-color: #B0ACFF"><tt>C-x o</tt></span></li>

<li>
Show the Hello.java buffer. <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-x b</span></tt> type
<tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">Hello</span></tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF"></span><tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">.java</span></tt> and hit&nbsp;<span class="doThis">return</span>.</li>

<li>
Show only the Hello.java window. <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-x 1</span></tt>.</li>
</ul>

<hr><!-- Running -->
<h2>
Running your program</h2>
Now that we've compiled a working version of Hello.java, it's time to run
our program. Either type <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-c C-v C-r</span></tt> or select the menu JDE->
Run App. As a result emacs split your window and wrote "Hello World" to
the screen, along with some other status messages which are <b>NOT</b>
part of your program itself.&nbsp;
<hr><!-- Debugging --><!--
<H2>Debugging</H2>
Emacs and JDE contain a mechanism for debugging your programs as well.
Actually this is functionality provided by a program called jdb (Java
debugger) which jde uses.
<P>
Let's start by adding the following lines to our program Hi.java after the
<code>System.out ...</code> line:
<PRE><CODE class="doThis">
    System.out.println("This is a line.");
    System.out.println("This is another line.");
    System.out.println("This statement is false.");
</PRE></CODE>
Now compile your program, <CODE class="doThis">C-c C-v C-c</CODE>.
<P>
Instead of running it as we did last time we'll use the debugger. To start
it use <CODE class="doThis">C-c C-v C-d</CODE>. A bunch of text will appear
in a <CODE>*debugHi*</CODE> buffer. You will also see the symbol
<code>=&gt</code> next to the first <code>System.out</code> line in your
program. This arrow indicates what line of your program is about to be
executed. To execute this line we can use the command
<CODE class="doThis">C-x C-a C-n</CODE>, or select Jdb-&gt Next Line from the
menus. You should notice that somewhere amongst the other text in the
debugger's window the words "Hello World" appeared.
<P>
You can skip to an arbitrary line in your code by setting a breakpoint. The
breakpoint tells the debugger, "Stop here." Let's try this. Put your cursor
on the last <code>System.out</code> line. We'll set a breakpoint here by
typing <CODE class="doThis">C-x SPC</CODE> where SPC is the space bar.
<P>
Next we'll tell the debugger to run until it hits another breakpoint.
Type <CODE class="doThis">C-x C-a C-r</CODE> or select Jdb-&gt Continue for
the menus. You will see that in the debugger window that the next two lines
were output. Also notice our arrow has moved to the last line.
<P>
Finally, we will let the program finish running by telling the debugger to
continue again. <CODE class="doThis">C-x C-a C-r</CODE>.
<HR>
<H2>More Debugging</H2>
The debugger gives us the ability to step through our programs one line
at a time. We can also examine what is going on within our programs.
Edit Hi.java by removing all but the first <code>System.out</code> line.
You can do this easily by putting your cursor at the beginning of the
first line you wish to delete at typing <code class="doThis">C-k</code>.
This "kills" everything from your cursor to the end of the line. If
you want to "yank" back what you just killed type
<code class="doThis">C-y</code>. So kill the rest of the
<code>System.out</code> lines by typing <code class="doThis">C-k</code>
several times. Notice you can also kill the blank lines left behind by
typing <code>C-k</code> on a blank line.
<P>
We will now include a variable in the program to which we will assign
a value. Add the following lines after the <code>System.out</code> line.
<PRE><code class="doThis">
        int x;
        x = 2;
        x = x+6;

        System.out.println(x);
</pre></code>
Do the following:
<UL>
  <LI>Compile the program.  <code class="doThis">C-c C-v C-c</code>.
  <LI>Start debugging. <code class="doThis">C-c C-v C-d</code>.
  <LI>Move the cursor to the line that reads <code>x = x+6;</code>.
  <LI>Set a breakpoint on that line. <code class="doThis">C-x SPC</code>.
      (Remember SPC is the SPACE bar).
  <LI>Let the program continue to its next breakpoint.
      <code class="doThis">C-x C-a C-r</code>.

</UL>

Now we're going to take a look at the value stored in <code>x</code>.
<UL>
  <LI>Move the cursor so that it is on an <code>x</code>.
  <LI>Now we'll examine the value of <code>x</code> by typing
      <code class="doThis">C-x C-a C-r</code>  or selecting the menu:
      Jdb->Print Expression. 
</UL>
In the debugger buffer the line <code>x = 2</code> has appeared,
telling you that the value for <code>x</code> is 2. Why wasn't it
8? The line is <code>x = x + 6</code>. Remember that the line the
arrow is on has not been executed yet.
<P>
We can now step forward a line (<code class="doThis">C-x C-a C-n</code>)
and examine the value again to find that the debugger tells us that
<code>x</code> is in fact 8.
<P>
Now let's suppose something has gone terribly wrong and we want to stop
our program without letting it finish.
<UL>
  <LI>Move the cursor to the last line of the debugger, after
      <code>main[1]</code>.
  <LI>Type <code class="doThis">quit</code>.
</UL>
<P>
If you are familiar with jdb already you can enter regular jdb commands
at this prompt, in essence doing everything we've shown here by hand.
<HR>

You can now exit emacs by typing <tt><span style="background-color: #B0ACFF">C-x C-c</span></tt> or selecting Files->
