<h3>
Course Overview</h3>
A compiler translates a program from a higher level language to a lower level 
language which is executable.&nbsp; In this course, the basic theory and 
application of compilation is taught through a semester-long project: a compiler 
of a subset of the Java programming language to the MIPS assembly language.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The project will be implemented using the Java language.&nbsp; The structure of 
the program is linear, following the presentation of key topics: lexical 
analysis, parsing, abstract syntax, semantic analysis, activation records, and 
code generation.&nbsp; The student will gain not only 
an understanding of how to construct a compiler, but also the fundamental skills 
for interpreter writing as well.&nbsp; Further, compiler writing presents one of 
computer science's most beautiful bridges between fundamental theory and useful 
practice.&nbsp;<h3>
Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
	<li>To gain a deep, experiential understanding of the construction of 
	compilers and interpreters through a semester-long compiler implementation 
	project.</li>
	<li>To understand and implement the fundamental stages of a compiler: 
	lexical analysis (scanning), syntactic analysis (parsing), semantic analysis 
	(type checking), and code generation.</li>
	<li>To gain deeper insight to the inner workings of modern object-oriented 
	languages by implementing a subset of Java that includes inheritance and 
	polymorphism.</li>
	<li>To further the broader learning objectives of the Computer Science 
	major.</li>
</ul>

Note:&nbsp;
Generally, feel free to drop in if my office door is open.&nbsp; If it
is closed, I'm desperately seeking to keep on top of things and rabid attack

<h3>
Grading</h3>
<p>80% Assignments <br>10% Quizzes / Exams <br>5% Colloquium Attendance<br>5% 
Class Attendance / Participation </p>
&nbsp;<p>You are responsible to know the material from each lecture and reading 
assignment before the start of the next class.&nbsp; We may have some 
unannounced quizzes to maintain accountability.<p>Homework is due <b>at the beginning of lecture on the due date.</b>&nbsp;
Late homework will not necessarily be accepted.&nbsp; Code must be a legal
program in the relevant language in order to be graded.&nbsp; (It need
not be free from logic errors.)&nbsp; For compiled languages, this means
that the program must compile without error.&nbsp; For interpreted languages,
this means it must be interpretable without error.
<p>You are required to attend 2 colloquia or
approved departmental events over the course of the semester.&nbsp; Class attendance and participation is required.&nbsp; If you attend
all classes and are willing to participate, you'll get 100% for this part
of your grade.&nbsp; Even if you know enough to give a particular lecture,
please consider the value of helping your peers during in-class exercises.
<h3>
Honor Code</h3>
Honesty, Integrity, Honor. These are more important than anything we will teach 
in this class. Students can and are encouraged to help each other understand 
course concepts, but all graded work must be done independently unless otherwise 
specified (e.g. group work). Submitted work should be created by those 
submitting it. Submission of plagiarized code or design work is a violation of 
the Honor Code, which I strictly enforce. For detailed information about the 
Honor Code, see
<a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot">
http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot</a>.
<p>What is permitted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Discussing algorithms, syntax, and problem specifications with other 
	students </li>
	<li>Seeking assistance (as needed) from CS professors, students assistants, 
	and approved tutors </li>
	<li>Use of &quot;starter code&quot; supplied by your professor, or code you have 
	previously developed </li>
</ul>
<p>What is not permitted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sharing code: Verbal dictation of code, transference of code (e.g. 
	e-mail, file transfer, entry of printed output, etc.). An important 
	component of this experiential learning process is developing the ability to 
	independently devise algorithms and express them in program code. </li>
	<li>Viewing and/or using unauthorized code (e.g. solutions found online, 
	downloads from code repositories, etc.) </li>
	<li>Submitting work that implicitly takes credit for work that should be 
	credited to others </li>
	<li>Efforts to obscure the source of unauthorized work </li>
	<li>Outsourcing work </li>
</ul>
<p>Put simply, students may discuss assignments at an abstract level (e.g. 
specifications, algorithm pseudocode), but must actually implement solutions 
independently or in permitted groups. Credit should be given where credit is 
due. Let your conscience be your guide. Do not merely focus on the result; learn 
from the process.</p>
