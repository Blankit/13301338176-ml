<br><b>Due: The beginning of class </b>on Tuesday 1/31 (test cases on Thursday 
1/26)<p><b>Note: </b>This work is to be done in <b>groups of 2</b>.&nbsp; Each group will submit one assignment.&nbsp; Although 
you may divide the work, both team members should be able to present/describe 
their partner's work upon request.&nbsp; 
<p><b>0. HW1 Preparation:</b> Download the given <a href="hw1">starter code</a> and read Chapter 1 thoroughly.&nbsp; The 
test statements of <tt><a href="hw1/SLPTest.java">SLPTest</a></tt> are difficult to read in their abstract syntax 
construction form, so consider initially compiling and running <tt>
<a href="hw1/SLPTest.java">SLPTest</a></tt> to see 
(through use of recursive <tt>toString</tt> methods) these statements in their original 
source code form.</p>

<p><b>1. Maximum Print Arguments:</b> Read Programming Problem 1 on p.12.&nbsp; This method in <tt>
<a href="hw1/SLPTest.java">SLPTest</a></tt> 
initiates a recursion over an abstract syntax tree to evaluate <tt>maxargs</tt>.&nbsp; 
However, most maxargs methods have been trivially (and incorrectly) implemented 
as &quot;<tt>return 0;</tt>&quot;.&nbsp; Your challenge is to implement the <tt>maxargs</tt> methods of the 
abstract syntax classes correctly.&nbsp; Note: If there are no print statements, 
the result should be 0. Also note that print statements can occur within print 
statement arguments through <i>expression sequences</i> (<tt><a href="hw1/EseqExp.java">EseqExp</a></tt>).&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>2. Interpreting Straight-Line Programs: </b>Read Programming Problem 2 on pp. 12-14.&nbsp; This method in <tt>
<a href="hw1/SLPTest.java">SLPTest</a></tt>
initiates a recursion over an abstract syntax tree to evaluate <tt>interp</tt>, that is, 
to execute the straight-line program.&nbsp; However, most <tt>interp</tt> methods have 
been trivially (and incorrectly) implemented as &quot;<tt>return null;</tt>&quot;.&nbsp; Your 
challenge is to implement the <tt>interp</tt> methods of the abstract syntax classes 
correctly.</p>

<p><b>3. Extended Testing (due Thursday 1/26): </b>Add at least five useful test statements to the statements array of <tt>
<a href="hw1/SLPTest.java">SLPTest</a></tt>.&nbsp; The correct output for the test statements supplied are as 
follows:</p>

<pre>$ java SLPTest
Program:
a := 5 + 3; b := (print(a, a - 1), 10 * a); print(b)
Max Arguments: 2
Execution Output:
8 7
80
Program:
print(2, 3, 4)
Max Arguments: 3
Execution Output:
2 3 4
Program:
print((print(2, 3, 4), 1))
Max Arguments: 3
Execution Output:
2 3 4
1
Program:
print((print(1), 2), 3, 4)
Max Arguments: 3
Execution Output:
1
2 3 4
Program:
a := 1; print(a); a := 2; print(a)
Max Arguments: 1
Execution Output:
1
2
Program:
a := 1; print(a); print((a := 2, a)); print(a)
Max Arguments: 1
Execution Output:
1
2
2
Program:
print((a := 1, a), (a := a + 1, a), (a := a + 1, a))
Max Arguments: 3
Execution Output:
1 2 3

<h3>Supplemental Chapter Comments</h3>

<p>(These comments are to supplement your reading.&nbsp; Question(s) asked are for 
you to think about on your own and need not be turned in with the homework.)</p>
<p>Early on, skim Appendix A in anticipation of our implementation of a MiniJava 
compiler.&nbsp; In what ways do you observe that MiniJava has been simplified 
from Java?&nbsp; What is most surprising?&nbsp; Are there alternative ways that 
MiniJava can accomplish the same computation as some familiar forms that are 
missing?</p>
<p><b>1.1:</b> Don't be concerned if the jargon in Figure 1.1 doesn't mean much 
to you at this stage.&nbsp; Think of it as being an approximate syllabus for the 
course.&nbsp; You'll understand Figure 1.1 very well by the end of the course. 
The same goes for Table 1.2, but do read it as best you can at this stage.&nbsp; 
Come back to this section regularly for a bird's eye view of what we're 
accomplishing.</p>
<p><b>1.2:</b> There is considerable overlap in the topics of Chapters 2 and 3 
and our theoretical computer science coverage of CS 201/301.&nbsp; We'll avoid 
repetition of such material.&nbsp; If you'll be taking the Computer Science GRE 
subject test before completing CS301, be sure to dig into the material we'll 
skim <i>now</i>.&nbsp; I'll be glad to help you one-on-one.<br>
We'll be using the tool JavaCC for this course.<br>
<br>
<b>1.3: </b>We'll be covering the semantics (meaning) of straight-line programs 
in class.&nbsp; Read the style and modularity conventions thoroughly.&nbsp; The 
classes of Program 1.5 (along with toString methods) are supplied <a href="hw1">
here</a>.</p>
