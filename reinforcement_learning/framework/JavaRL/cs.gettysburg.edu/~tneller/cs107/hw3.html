<p><b>1. Polynomial: </b>A polynomial is a function of the form c<sub>0</sub> *
<em>x</em><sup>0</sup> + c<sub>1</sub> * <em>x</em><sup>1</sup> + c<sub>2</sub> 
* <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + ... + c<sub>n</sub> * <em>x</em><sup>n</sup>.&nbsp; 
Since <em>x</em><sup>0</sup>=1, this is equivalent to c<sub>0</sub> + c<sub>1</sub> 
* <em>x</em> + c<sub>2</sub> * <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + ... + c<sub>n</sub> *
<em>x</em><sup>n</sup>.&nbsp; All polynomial curve can be expressed in this 
form.&nbsp; The familiar line <em>y</em> = m<em>x</em> + b has n=1 with c<sub>1</sub> 
being slope m and c<sub>0</sub> being <em>y</em>-intercept b.&nbsp; A quadratic 
curve <em>y</em> = a<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + b<em>x</em> + c has n=2 with c<sub>0</sub>, 
c<sub>1</sub>, and c<sub>2</sub> being c, b, and a, respectively.</p>
<p>You will create a polynomial function &quot;polynomial&quot; in file polynomial.m that 
takes in (1) a <em>scalar</em> x, and (2) a vector coeff of coefficients (e.g. 
[c0 c1 c2]) and returns the y for that given polynomial.&nbsp; Note: The degree 
n of the polynomial is implicitly given by the length of the coefficient vector.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Example usage:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; polynomial(7, [5])<br>ans =<br>5<br>&gt;&gt; polynomial(7, [5 2])<br>ans =<br>19<br>
&gt;&gt; polynomial(7, [5 2 3])<br>ans =<br>166</p>
<p><b>2. Numerical Integration: </b>While symbolic integration, the symbolic 
manipulation we 
learn in Calculus classes, is important and has valuable applications, there are 
many occasions where one is given raw data to integrate rather than a function.&nbsp; 
Given a function y = f(<i>x</i>), integration attempts to find the area underneath the 
curve over some interval.&nbsp; When one is given raw (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) values, a common 
simple method for integration is, for each adjacent pair of points, (<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>, 
<i>f</i>(<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>)) 
and (<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i>+1</sub>, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i>+1</sub>)) to consider the trapezoid formed by these points and (<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>, 0) 
and (<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i>+1</sub>, 0).&nbsp; A simple, good <i>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration">numerical 
integration</a></i> approximation of the integral of a function can be formed by 
computing and summing the area of these trapezoids.&nbsp; Note: Area below the 
axis y = 0 is considered negative area.</p>
<p>For this exercise, we'll take a function sin(<i>x</i>) with a known integral 
function -cos(<i>x</i>), and compare the results of this trapezoidal numerical integration 
technique with the known correct results.</p>
<p>Begin by downloading the m-file called <code>
<a href="code/trapezoidIntegrate.m">trapezoidIntegrate.m</a></code>.  and follow 
the implementation instructions therein.</p>
&nbsp;Example usage: Here is the printed output of three calls to 
trapezoidIntegrate(dx) with dx assigned .1, 
.001, and .00001, respectively.
<pre>From 0 to 1.5708 with step 0.1, the approximate area is 0.928488.
The actual area is 1, so the error is 0.0715117.

From 0 to 1.5708 with step 0.001, the approximate area is 0.999204.
The actual area is 1, so the error is 0.00079641.

From 0 to 1.5708 with step 1e-005, the approximate area is 0.999994.
The actual area is 1, so the error is 6.3268e-006.</pre>
<b>3. 

Numerical Differentiation:</b> Differentiation is the process of computing the 
rate of change, or slope, of a function.&nbsp; In cases where we are given a 
function that has no simple symbolic differentiation, we can turn to <i>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_differentiation">numerical 
differentiation</a></i>.&nbsp; 

<p>Imagine you are standing at a point on a mountain slope, and you wish to 
measure the slope where you're standing.&nbsp; A single point altitude doesn't 
help.&nbsp; However, suppose you take an accurate altitude reading both one 
small step uphill and one small step downhill.&nbsp; By dividing the rise 
(change in altitude between the steps) by the run (distance horizontally between 
the two steps), we gain a good estimate for the slope where you're standing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This analogy describes the simple <i>three-point estimation method</i>.&nbsp; Given an
<i>x</i> 
value, a function <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>), and a small step <i>h</i>, one can estimate the derivative 
(i.e. slope) of <i>f</i> at <i>x</i> as (<i>f</i>(<i>x</i> + <i>h</i>) - <i>f</i>(<i>x</i> - 
<i>h</i>)) / (2 * <i>h</i>). </p>
<p>For this exercise, we'll again take the function sin(<i>x</i>) with a known 
derivative function cos(<i>x</i>), and compare the results of this numerical 
differentiation 
technique with the known correct results along a sequence of points.</p>
<p>Begin by creating a function called <code>simpleDifferentiate.m</code>.  
Function <code>simpleDifferentiate </code>will take dx and h as parameters (in 
that order).&nbsp; It will return the greatest (maximum absolute) error.&nbsp; First, assign values to a set of 
variables:</p>
<pre>
xMin = 0; % minimum x test value
xMax = 2 * pi; % maximum x test value
x = xMin:dx:xMax; % x test values
</pre>
<p>Next, compute a vector of <i>y</i> values for sin(<i>x</i>).<br>
Plot <i>x</i> versus <i>y</i> as dots and hold the graph output.<br>
Compute estimates and exact values for the derivative (cos(x)) at each <i>x</i> test 
value, plotting each with &quot;x&quot; marks and lines, respectively.&nbsp; An example 
plot for the variable values above appears below.<br>
Finally, compute the maximum absolute error in the estimation, and display the 
following output (with &lt;placeholders&gt; substituted with values):</p>
<pre>From &lt;xMin&gt; to &lt;xMax&gt; with step &lt;dx&gt;, we numerically differentiate with h = &lt;h&gt;.
The greatest error is &lt;maximum absolute error&gt; at x = &lt;x value for maximum absolute error&gt;.
</pre>
For example, here is the output of three m-file executions with <em>dx</em> = .1 
and <i>h</i> assigned .5, 
.05, and .005, respectively.
<pre>From 0 to 6.28319 with step 0.1, we numerically differentiate with h = 0.5.
The greatest error is 0.0411489 at x = 0.
From 0 to 6.28319 with step 0.1, we numerically differentiate with h = 0.05.
The greatest error is 0.000416615 at x = 0.
From 0 to 6.28319 with step 0.1, we numerically differentiate with h = 0.005.
The greatest error is 4.16666e-006 at x = 0.</pre>
