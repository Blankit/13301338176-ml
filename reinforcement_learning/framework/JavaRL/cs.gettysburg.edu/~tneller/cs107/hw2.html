<p><b>1. Wheat on a Chessboard: </b>In

The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the 
History of Mathematics</a></i>, Clifford Pickover writes:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The problem of Sissa's chessboard is notable in the history of 
	mathematics because it has been used for centuries to demonstrate the nature 
	of geometric growth or geometric progressions, and it is one of the earliest 
	mentions of chess in puzzles.&nbsp; The Arabic scholar Ibn Khallikan in 1256 
	appears to be the first author to discuss the story of Grand Vizier Sissa 
	ben Dahir, who, according to legend, was asked by the Indian King Shirham 
	what reward he wanted for inventing the game of chess.</p>
	<p>Sissa addressed the king: &quot;Majesty, I would be happy if you were to give 
	me a grain of wheat to place on the first square of the chessboard, and two 
	grains of wheat to place on the second square, and four grains of wheat to 
	place on the third, and eight grains of wheat to place on the fourth, and so 
	on for the sixty-four squares.&quot;</p>
	<p>&quot;And is that all you wish, Sissa, you fool?&quot; the astonished King shouted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a single expression, compute the number of grains of wheat that Sissa 
requested.&nbsp; (Related unassigned problems: text exercises 3.1, 3.2)</p>  
<p><b>2. Drawing a Square:</b> Exercise 3.6.&nbsp; Hint: &quot;help plot&quot;.</p>
<p><b>3. Boolean Expression: </b>Exercise 3.8.&nbsp; To present your work, 
you'll be provided&nbsp;
<font face="Courier New">a,</font> <font face="Courier New">b,</font> and
<span class="style1">N</span> vectors 
of appropriate respective values to cover all cases (e.g. sum greater and b 
nonnegative, sum greater and b negative, etc.).</p>
<p><b>4. Counting Leap Years: </b>Exercise 3.12.&nbsp; Hint: start with a vector of 
years.&nbsp; Then evaluate Boolean vectors associated with the various 
conditions of the problem.&nbsp; Hint 2: &quot;help mod&quot;.&nbsp; Finally, combine these vectors and perform an 
appropriate operation to compute the total number of leap years.&nbsp; See the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year">Wikipedia article</a> for 
clarification: &quot;Years that are evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years, 
unless they are also evenly divisible by 400, in which case they are leap years.<a href="#cite_note-rog-1"></a>&quot;</p>
