<p><b>1. Retirement Investing Analysis:&nbsp;</b> Using the Monte Carlo analysis 
techniques we developed in class as a starting point, come up with a realistic 
stock investment plan, making clear your assumptions, and backing your plan with 
analysis.&nbsp; In particular, in the initial comments of <code>invest.m</code>, describe 
your assumptions of (1) work years, (2) savings rate, and (3) goal of income 
replacement.&nbsp; You may, if desired, extend our approach in many ways, 
including the addition of bond data, social security projections, non-uniform 
savings rates, etc.&nbsp; By running <code>invest.m</code>, the grader should be able to 
reproduce the simulations, graphs, etc. that support your plan, which should be 
outlined in the initial comments of <code>invest.m</code>.&nbsp; This exercise is a practical 
opportunity to apply Monte Carlo analysis to your (hopefully) great future 
benefit!&nbsp; Function <code>invest</code> should have no parameters and return 
the estimated probability of success for your plan. Note: The grading submission 
system will merely judge that the probability for success is valid.&nbsp; 
Separate evaluation (i.e. reading) by the grader will be necessary to score this 
problem.</p>
<p><b>2. Pythagorean Triples: </b>&nbsp;Exercise 8.18 with the following 
modifications: In <code>triples.m</code>, take the maximum value of <i>cMax</i> as input, rather than 
assuming 10,000 as a maximum value.&nbsp; To avoid redundant triples, restrict 
search such that <i>a</i> &le; <i>b</i>.&nbsp; Return 
the (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) triples as a <i>t</i>-by-3 matrix, where <i>t</i> 
is the number of triples.&nbsp; Thus, each row is a triple.&nbsp; Organize your loops 
such that these triples are sorted by <i>a</i>, then <i>b</i>.&nbsp; In other words, 
the first column of <i>a </i>values is sorted, and if there are multiple triples 
with a given <i>a</i> value, then <i>b</i> values will be sorted among these 
triples.&nbsp; <em>Hint: Your triples will be sorted correctly if you loop 
through values of a and b correctly.</em></p>
<p><b>3. Dot Product: </b>In <code>dotProd.m</code>, use loops to create your own dot product 
function that takes two equal-length vectors and returns their dot product.&nbsp; 
If the two vectors are not of equal length, print &quot;dotProd: input vector lengths 
do not match&quot;, and return an empty list.&nbsp; A dot product of two vectors <i>
v1</i> and <i>v2</i> of length <i>n</i> is <i>v1</i>(1) * <i>v2</i>(1) + <i>v1</i>(2) 
* <i>v2</i>(2) + ... + <i>v1</i>(<i>n</i>) * <i>v2</i>(<i>n</i>).</p>
<p><b>4. Matrix Multiplication:&nbsp; </b>In <code>matMult.m</code>, use loops to create your 
own matrix multiplication function that takes an <i>m</i>-by-<i>n</i> matrix <i>
m1</i> and an <i>n</i>-by-<i>p</i> matrix <i>m2</i>, and returns the <i>m</i>-by-<i>p</i> 
matrix <i>m3</i> resulting from the matrix multiplication of <i>m1</i> and <i>m2</i>.&nbsp; 
If the number of columns in <i>m1</i> does not match the number of rows in <i>m2</i>, 
print &quot;matMult: input matrices are not compatible&quot;, and return an empty list.&nbsp; 
Otherwise, return <i>m3</i>.&nbsp; The value at <i>m3</i>(<i>i</i>, <i>k</i>) is 
the dot product of row <i>i</i> in <i>m1</i> and (transposed) column <i>k</i> in
<i>m2</i>. </p>
