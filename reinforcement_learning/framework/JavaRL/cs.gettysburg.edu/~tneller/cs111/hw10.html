<br><b>Due: Friday 4/7 at the beginning of class</b><p><b>1.&nbsp; Dice Histogram:</b> Call your class
<tt>DiceHistogram.java</tt>. In this exercise, you will simulate the throwing of 
2 standard six-sided dice a given number of times and display the resulting 
distribution as a text-based histogram. First, ask the user how many time to 
roll the dice. Then simulate the dice rolling and print the maximum number of 
times a sum was rolled. Next print lines for each possible dice roll showing a 
number of asterisks proportional to the number of times the sum was rolled. 
Scale the number of asterisks such that the sum rolled the most will have 60 
asterisks.&nbsp; Example transcript (user input <u>underlined</u>): </p>
<pre>How many rolls? <b><u>1000000</u></b>
Max count: 166039

<p>Possible &quot;stepping stones&quot; towards the goal: (1) Print the given number of 
roll sums. Remember: The sum of two 6-sided dice is different than a single roll 
of an 11-sided die numbered 2 through 12.&nbsp; (Why?)&nbsp; (2) Use an array to 
count the number of rolls for each sum and print a table (i.e. numbers instead 
of histogram asterisks above).&nbsp; (3) Compute and print the maximum count.&nbsp; 
(4) Round (60.0 * count / maximum) for each count to compute the number of 
asterisks, and print the histogram as shown.</p>

<p><b>2.&nbsp; ChompGame:</b> Chomp is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">
Nim</a>-type game in which two players take bites of a gridded cookie in turn.&nbsp; 
Each bite at a given row and column consumes the cookie at, below, and to the 
right of that position.&nbsp; The player taking the last bite in the first row 
and first column loses.</p>
<p>Implement <tt>ChompGame.java</tt> according to <a href="chompdoc/ChompGame.html">this specification</a>.&nbsp; This class 
will <em>model</em> the game, and could serve as a basis for a text-based game 
interface (next exercise), a graphical user interface (GUI), game simulation for 
analysis/machine learning, etc.&nbsp; No scanning of input or printing of output 
will take place in this class, so you'll need another class (see next exercise) 
to effectively test this code.</p>

<p><b>3.&nbsp; Chomp:</b> For this exercise, design and implement <tt>Chomp.java</tt> 
according to <a href="chompdoc/Chomp.html">this specification</a> such that two 
players can play a text-based version of chomp for a given board size up to at 
least size 10-by-10.&nbsp; Use class <tt>ChompGame</tt> for modeling the game state itself. All 
input/output for text-based play should take place in the main method of this class. <br></p>
<p>First, 
print instructions with the following lines: {&quot;CHOMP&quot;, &quot;In the game of Chomp, 
players bite a rectangular cookie in turn.&quot;, &quot;The player chomping the last bite 
(0,0) loses.&quot;, &quot;Each chomp, a row and column, bites off all below and to the 
right.&quot;}. Then prompt the user for the number of rows 
and columns with prompts &quot;Rows? &quot; and &quot;Columns? &quot;. Read these in as integers 
presumed to be in the range 1-10.&nbsp; Create a <tt>ChompGame</tt> object 
using this information. </p>
<p>Then, while the game is not over, do the following: Print the game board produced by the object toString() and preceded and 
followed with blank lines. Prompt the user for a row and column for 
chomping with &quot;Player # chomp? &quot;, where &quot;#&quot; is the games current player number.&nbsp; Attempt the chomp move, making the move and changing the player if the chomp 
move is legal, and just printing the message &quot;That is not a legal chomp 
position.&quot; otherwise.<br></p>
<p>After the game is over, print a blank line and the 
message &quot;Player # wins!&quot;, where &quot;#&quot; is the winning player.<br></p>
<p>No input/output 
should take place in class &lt;code&gt;Chomp&lt;/code&gt;. Whenever possible, use the 
computation of the Chomp class to perform the modeling (i.e. play, logic) of the 
game.</p>
<p>Example transcript (input <span class="style1">underlined</span>):</p>
<pre>CHOMP

The player chomping the last bite (0,0) loses.
Each chomp, a row and column, bites off all below and to the right.
