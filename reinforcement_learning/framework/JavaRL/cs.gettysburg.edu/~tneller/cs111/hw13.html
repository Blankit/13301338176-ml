<br><b>Due: Friday 4/28 at the beginning of class</b><h2>Hex<b> (Part 1)</b> </h2>
<p><b>0. Learn the game of Hex: </b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Read about the game at
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)">
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)</a> or
	<a href="http://hexwiki.amecy.com/index.php/Main_Page">
	http://hexwiki.amecy.com/index.php/Main_Page</a> </li>
	<li>Play a game with a friend using two color pens and
	<a href="http://hexwiki.amecy.com/index.php/Printable_boards">printed boards</a>.&nbsp; 
	Or play a <a href="http://hexwiki.amecy.com/index.php/Computer_Hex">computer 
	implementation</a>.&nbsp; Or
	<a href="http://hexwiki.amecy.com/index.php/Online_playing">play online</a>.&nbsp; 
	Just play. (Note: One can always play Hex on a checkerboard using red and 
	blue Poker chips and considering squares adjacent along one diagonal.)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>1. Implement HexState: </b>Implement a class <tt>HexState.java</tt> 
according to <a href="hex/doc/HexState.html">this specification</a>.&nbsp; This 
will likely be your most significant and challenging homework assignment of the 
semester, so start early.&nbsp; Note:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Read the documentation carefully.&nbsp; Your integer constants for
	<strong>PLAYER2</strong>, <strong>NONE</strong>, and <strong>PLAYER1</strong> 
	need to be <strong>-1</strong>, <strong>0</strong>, and <strong>1</strong>, 
	respectively.&nbsp; Don't just read the method summaries.&nbsp; Some have 
	additional necessary specification details beyond the summary tables.</li>
	<li>It is easiest to represent Hex's
	<a href="http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/InterpretingASquareGridAsAHexagonalGrid/">
	rhombic hexagonal grid board as a square grid</a>, using&nbsp; a 2D array of 
	the aforementioned integer constants.&nbsp; Let grid cells be adjacent if 
	they are vertically adjecent, horizontally adjacent, or diagonally adjacent 
	along the diagonal where the row and column both increase/decrease together.</li>
	<li>The most challenging method you'll implement will be the <strong>
	getWinner</strong> method.&nbsp; Determining the winner will require you to 
	devise an algorithm that is related to your 2D maze solving algorithm.&nbsp; 
	Think of it this way: Player 1, seeking to connect the top row to the bottom 
	row, wins if there is an unbroken path of connected pieces running from the 
	bottom row to the top row (or vice versa).&nbsp; Finding that path is like 
	finding a maze path from any player 1 piece on the bottom row through 
	passages of same colored pieces and reaching the top row.&nbsp; All player 2 
	pieces and empty spaces can be considered walls of the maze.&nbsp; If 
	there's a solution to this player 1 &quot;maze&quot;, player 1 has won.&nbsp; 
	Similarly, player 2 seeks a path along their own pieces from the leftmost 
	column to the rightmost column.&nbsp; Study the maze code and adapt it as 
	necessary (e.g. don't forget that you'll have 6 directions to search).</li>
	<li>The constructor that copies another HexState must make a <strong>&quot;deep 
	copy&quot;</strong>.&nbsp; That means you need to not merely copy the reference 
	to the given state's board.&nbsp; You need to allocate a new, independent 2D 
	array and copy the contents over to the new object.&nbsp; Without a correct 
	implementation of this constructor, the undo function will not work.</li>
	<li>The <strong>toString</strong> method is the second longest method you'll 
	implement, but there are full details of the implementation in the
	<a href="hex/doc/HexState.html">specification</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2. Test HexState:</b> Test your <tt>HexState</tt> class using the provided
<tt>Hex.java</tt> <a href="hex/Hex.java">Graphical User Interface (GUI)</a>.&nbsp; Usage: &quot;java 
Hex&quot;.&nbsp; Single-click onto 
an empty hex grid cell to play a piece in that spot.&nbsp; Press &quot;u&quot; to undo a 
move.&nbsp; You can also use the &quot;Game&quot; menu to undo a move, restart a game, 
start a game with a different size board, or go to a website where people play 
Hex online.&nbsp; Note that playing with this GUI prints a transcript of play to 
the standard output that will be useful 
for testing your text-based <tt>HexGame.java</tt> in the next homework 
assignment.</p>
