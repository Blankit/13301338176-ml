<p><b>1. Name That Method:&nbsp; </b>Written Exercise R2.18.&nbsp; Additionally, what 
would be a good name for the method?&nbsp; Hint: If this one has you stumped, add it 
to your <tt>BankAccount</tt> class definition and experiment with it using at 
least two <tt>BankAccount</tt> objects. </p>
<p><b>2. Find the Errors:&nbsp; </b>Written Exercise R5.1.&nbsp; Correction: The second to 
last and third to last bullets should be combined.</p>
<p>
    <b>3. Omitted Else: </b>Written Exercise R5.9.&nbsp; Create a table with
    each of the 4 cases possible with different values of x and y, and indicate
    the value of s at the end of the execution of these blocks of code.
</p>

<p><b>4. Car:&nbsp; </b>Programming Exercise P2.10.&nbsp; In addition, check for invalid 
parameters.&nbsp; For instance, a negative or zero mileage makes no sense, so print 
an error message if the user attempts to create a car with a non-positive 
mileage.&nbsp; Also, cars shouldn't be able to regain gas by driving backwards.&nbsp; 
Print error messages for all invalid parameters.&nbsp; Add a method <tt>getGas</tt> 
that returns the gallons of gas remaining.&nbsp; Add a method <tt>getMiles</tt> that 
returns the total miles traveled.&nbsp; If the user requests a car to drive so as to 
run out of gas, print the message &quot;<tt>Out of gas</tt>&quot; and have the car only 
travel as far as the gas would permit, leaving an empty gas tank.&nbsp; Write a test 
program called <tt>CarTest.java</tt> that creates a car and demonstrates that 
each line of code functions properly.&nbsp; That is, be sure to test each case such 
that all lines of code (including error messages) are exercised. Use double 
values throughout.</p>
<p><b>5. Optimal Piglet Advisor: </b>Here is a description of a simple coin game 
called Piglet.&nbsp; (Piglet is based on a simple dice game called
<a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/index.html">Pig</a>.): </p>
<p>The object of Piglet is to be the first player to reach <i>n</i> points. (In 
this case, we'll use <i>n</i> = 6.)&nbsp; Each turn, a player repeatedly flips a coin 
until either a &quot;tail&quot; is flipped or the player holds.&nbsp; At any time during 
the player's turn, the player is faced with two choices: <i>flip</i> or <i>hold</i>. 
If the coin turns up tails, the player scores nothing for the turn and it 
becomes the opponent's turn. Otherwise, the player's turn continues. If the 
player chooses to <i>hold</i>, the number of consecutively flipped heads is 
added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn. </p>
<p>Below is a table that describe the <i>optimal</i> way to play Piglet when the 
goal score is 6.&nbsp; The way you read the table is as follows:&nbsp; The rows are 
numbered 0 to 5 downward.&nbsp; The columns are numbered 0 to 5 rightward.&nbsp; If your 
score is <i>i</i> and your opponent's score is <i>j</i>, then the number at row
<i>i</i>, column <i>j</i> is the number of consecutive heads at which you should 
hold.&nbsp; Otherwise, keep flipping. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="piglet6.png" border="0" width="156" height="151">
</p>
<p>Your task is to create an optimal Piglet advisor.&nbsp; Call your program <tt>
PigletAdvisor.java</tt>.&nbsp; Use a Scanner to ask the user for (1) their score, and 
(2) their opponent's score.&nbsp; If the score(s) are invalid, the output 
&quot;Invalid scores&quot;.&nbsp; Otherwise, the output should be &quot;You should hold after # 
heads.&quot;, where # is given in the above table and &quot;heads&quot; is properly singular or 
plural depending on #.</p>
<p>Hint: There is no need to store a table (e.g. 2D array introduced later) if 
you notice that the table can be divided into cases: (1) either player has 5 
points or the sum of the scores is 7 or more and you need to try to win this 
turn, (2) players each have exactly three points and you should hold at 1 head, 
(3) you're even or behind and should hold at 2, and (4) otherwise, you should 
hold at 1.&nbsp; These cases should be handled in this order using an if-else chain 
to determine the hold value.&nbsp; </p>
