<hr>
<br><b>Due: Monday 1/30 at the beginning of class. We will go through the 
submission process together in class on Monday.</b>&nbsp; Make sure you have 
your complete README file, Hello.java, and HelloMe.java files together in the 
same directory beforehand.<p><b>NOTE:</b> For each assignment, you should submit not only the requested program files, 
but also a simple text file called <code>README</code>.&nbsp; 
<code>README</code> files are often used by 
programmers to comment on the contents of a directory or give vital information.&nbsp; 
Please make sure this plain text file is named &quot;<code>README</code>&quot;, not &quot;<code>README.txt</code>&quot;, 
&quot;<code>readme</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>ReadMe.txt</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>Read 
me.doc</code>&quot;, etc.&nbsp; For each assignment, your <code>README</code> 
file will contain:<ul>
  <li>
  <a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/assignment-honor-pledge.dot">The Honor Pledge</a>: 
  &quot;I affirm that I have upheld the highest principles of honesty and integrity 
  in my academic work and have not witnessed a violation of the Honor Code.&quot;</li>
  <li>Your name</li>
  <li>Your Gettysburg ID number (For department assignment purposes, your name 
  and Gettysburg ID number in combination constitute a digital signature of the 
  Honor Pledge.)</li>
  <li>Answers to written questions</li>
  </ul>
<ol>
<li>
Read Chapter 1.</li>
<li>
Do the bash tutorial (<a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/dept/bash-tutorial.html">"Getting started with bash at Gettysburg"</a>), 
ignoring the part on &quot;cvs&quot; submission.&nbsp; Do the tutorial in one sitting so that you'll
be able to submit a transcript of your shell commands.&nbsp; NOTE: Following all 
instructions will create a README file with evidence of your work, or add such 
evidence to one if you've already created it.</li>

<li>
In class on<strong> </strong>Friday, 
we'll do the <a href="helloworld.html">E<span class="link-label">clipse Hello 
World Tutorial</span></a><span class="link-label"> together.&nbsp; You'll be submitting the Java file 
&quot;Hello.java&quot; you create according to these instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you 
follow the tutorial instructions, you will find this file in your &quot;hw1&quot; 
directory within your &quot;workspace&quot; directory.&nbsp;
</span>The more you know of your work environment, the more efficient you will
be.&nbsp; A little time spent above and beyond these tutorials will likely
pay off significantly in the long run as a CS major/minor.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Create a separate Java application called <code>HelloMe.java</code> 
that prints &quot;<code>Hello, </code>&lt;<i>name</i>&gt;<code>!</code>&quot;, 
inserting your name for &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;.<li>
In your own words, define the terms:</li>

<ol>
<li>
compiler</li>

<li>
interpreter</li>

<li>
Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</li>
</ol>

<li>
What do the commands "<code>java</code>" and "<code>javac</code>" have to do with the previous terms?</li>

<li>
In your own words, describe these errors.&nbsp; When is each type of error
encountered in the programming process (e.g. editing stage, compilation stage,
execution stage, etc.)?</li>

<ol>
<li>
syntax error</li>

<li>
logic error</li>

</ol>
