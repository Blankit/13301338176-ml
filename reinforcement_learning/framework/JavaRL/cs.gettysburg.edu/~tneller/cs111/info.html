<h3 > Course Overview</h3>

<p>On the surface it appears that Computer Science is
a very dynamic discipline. However, there are certain principles that
are basic to Computer Science. These are the fundamentals that enable
us to solve problems within the context
of a hardware environment. For that reason this course has a heavy
emphasis
on the methodology of problem solving with the use of computing
equipment,
algorithms, and the implementation of those algorithms in a specific
programming
language.&nbsp; Because of the importance of the Internet and the World
Wide
Web, this course will be taught using the Java programming
language.&nbsp;
Exercises will introduce the student to basic computing concepts, data
types,
classes and methods, decisions, iteration, testing and debugging,
arrays and vectors, and other selected topics.&nbsp;
The goal of these exercises is to illustrate good programming
principles,
an understanding of object oriented programming, programming and
elementary
data structures, as well as some basic software engineering principles.
Students
will have weekly homework exercises throughout the term that will
provide
a solid foundation of experience for future problem-solving.</p>
<h3> Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Learn the syntax and semantics of a high-level programming
language, including basic computation, simple input/output, standard
conditional and iterative structures, and functions (a.k.a. methods).</li>
  <li>Gain the ability to design, implement, test, debug, analyze, and
explain the behavior of simple high-level computer programs.</li>
  <li>Develop a basic discipline of "computational thinking", whereby a
problem is approached by representing relevant information with simple
data structures, making using of appropriate control structures,
methods, and object-oriented abstraction, and applying relevant problem
solving patterns to compute a solution. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Student Assistants</h3>
<p> In-class Assistants:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section A: Thy Do (TA office hours Thursday,
7:30-9:30PM, Glatfelter 207)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section B: Alexi Doak (TA
office hours Tuesday, 7-9PM, Glatfelter 207)</p>
<p> Grading Assistants: Will Czubakowski (TA
office hours Monday, 7-9PM, Glatfelter 207)
and Kevin Maldonado (TA office hours Wednesday, 7-9PM, Glatfelter 207)</p>
<h3> Grading</h3>
60% Assignments <br>
20% MyProgrammingLab Activities (4th Hour Requirement)<br>
10% Quizzes / Exams <br>
5% Colloquium Attendance<br>
5% Class Attendance / Participation
<p>You are responsible to know the material from each lecture and
reading assignment before the start of the next class.&nbsp; Homework
is due <b>at the beginning of lecture on the due date.</b>&nbsp; Late
homework will not
necessarily be accepted.&nbsp; <b>Source code that does not compile
may
not receive partial credit.&nbsp; </b>You are required to <strong>attend 2 
colloquia</strong> or approved departmental events over the course of the 
semester.</p>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Class attendance and participation is
required.&nbsp; If you attend all classes and are willing to
participate, you'll get 100% for this part of your grade.&nbsp; Even if
you know enough to give a particular lecture, please consider the value
of helping your peers
during in-class exercises. </p>
<p>Woody Allen is quoted as saying
<a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/06/10/showing-up/">&quot;80% of success is 
just showing up.&quot;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; While our class attendance/participation grade 
is not 80% of the final grade, it is critical that late arrivals and unexcused 
absences are not excessive.&nbsp; Missing more than half of class unexcused is 
considered being absent.&nbsp; An unexcused late arrival is counted as a half 
absence.&nbsp; <strong>If the total number of absences counted this way exceeds 
20% of class meetings, i.e. 8.5 absences or more, the student will have failed 
the course.</strong></p>
<h3> Work Expectations</h3>
<p> You are expected to <strong>work an average of 9 hours per week beyond class 
time</strong>.&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.gettysburg.edu/faculty/documents/2014/GettysburCollege2014AcademicCourseCreditPolicyandDeclarationForm.pdf">
Gettysburg College policy</a>, in accordance with federal and state standards, 
equates 1 credit unit with an average of 12 hours of work per week with 50 
minute classes counting as 1 full hour of work.&nbsp; During these remaining 9 
hours beyond class, a student is expected to learn from assigned readings, 
complete exercises related to such readings, attend required colloquia, and 
complete assignments.</p>
<p> Think of your college studies as a more-than-full-time job, and engage in it 
with passion.&nbsp; After all, you get out of it what you put into it, and it is 
my hope that you'll gain much from your investment in this course.&nbsp; If 
you'd like to learn more about how to better track tasks and manage time as a 
student, consider watching <a href="../resources/gtd/summary.html">my short 
tutorial on getting things done</a>.</p>
<h3> Honor Code</h3>
<p>Honesty, Integrity, Honor.&nbsp; These are more important than anything
we will teach in this class.&nbsp; Students can and are encouraged to
help
each other understand course concepts, but all graded work must be done
independently unless otherwise specified (e.g. group work).&nbsp;
Submitted work should be created by those submitting it.&nbsp;
Submission of plagiarized code or design work is a violation of the
Honor Code, which I strictly enforce.&nbsp; For
detailed information about the Honor Code, see
<a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot">http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot</a>.
</p>
<p>What is permitted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Discussing algorithms, syntax, and problem specifications with
other students</li>
  <li>Seeking assistance (as needed) from CS professors, students
assistants, and approved tutors</li>
  <li>Use of "starter code" supplied by your professor, or code you
have previously developed</li>
</ul>
<p>What is not permitted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sharing code: Verbal dictation of code, transference of code
(e.g. e-mail, file transfer, entry of printed output, etc.).&nbsp; An
important component of this experiential learning process is developing
the ability to independently devise algorithms and express them in
program code.</li>
  <li>Viewing and/or using unauthorized code (e.g. solutions found
online, downloads from code repositories, etc.)</li>
  <li>Submitting work that implicitly takes credit for work that should
be credited to others</li>
  <li>Efforts to obscure the source of unauthorized work</li>
  <li>Outsourcing work</li>
</ul>
<p>Put simply, students may discuss assignments at an abstract level
(e.g. specifications, algorithm pseudocode), but must actually
implement solutions independently or in permitted groups.&nbsp; Credit
should be given where credit is due.&nbsp; Let your conscience be your
guide.&nbsp; Do not merely focus on the result; learn from the process.</p>
