<br><b>Due: Friday 3/24 at the beginning of class</b>
<p><b>1. Pig Game: </b>In file <tt>PigGame.java</tt>, implement this
<a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/resources/pig/cs1/game.html">
specification</a>.&nbsp; <i>Note: You'll want to copy your <tt>PigComputerGame.java</tt> 
code as a starting point.</i>
</p>
<!-- <p><b>2. Pythagorean Triples:</b> Implement <tt>
PythagoreanTriples.java</tt> such that the main method prints all Pythagorean 
triples for integers up to and including 500.&nbsp; A Pythagorean triple 
consists of three integers that could be the sides of a right triangle.&nbsp; 
Put another way, if 
<tt>side1</tt>2 + 
<tt>side2</tt>2 =
<tt>hypotenuse</tt>2 , then
<tt>(side1, side2, hypotenuse)</tt> is a Pythagorean triple.&nbsp; 
To avoid redundant output, retrict values to <tt>0 &lt; side1 &lt;= side2 &lt; hypotenuse &lt;= 500</tt>.&nbsp; Print each triple 
space-separated on a single line.&nbsp; Print triples in increasing order of <tt>
side1/tt>, <tt>side2</tt>, and <tt>hypotenuse</tt> by structuring your loops accordingly.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>-->
<p><strong>2. Statistics:</strong> In file <tt>
<a href="statistics/Statistics.java">Statistics.java</a></tt>, implement this
<a href="statistics/index.html">specification</a>.&nbsp; In addition to public 
static methods implementing simple statistics such as</p>
<ul>
	<li>minimum</li>
	<li>maximum</li>
	<li>sum</li>
	<li>mean (a.k.a. average), and</li>
	<li>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Basic_examples">
	population standard deviation</a>,</li>
</ul>
<p>you will also implement a bootstrapping technique for computing confidence 
intervals on the mean of given data.&nbsp; First, we'll describe the process, 
then we'll outline the algorithm parts.</p>
<p>Imagine that you have some data, such as win or loss values from 2-player 
gameplay.&nbsp; Let a first-player win or loss be counted as value 1 or 0, 
respectively.&nbsp; Suppose our initial data array consists of 7 wins and 3 
losses.&nbsp; Do we have 90% confidence that the first player has some advantage 
over the second player?&nbsp; Put another way, would we expect the mean win 
value to be above .5 with 90% confidence if we collected more data?&nbsp; The 
&quot;bootstrap&quot; is a versatile statistical approach that can help us with confidence 
intervals (and more) when the data doesn't follow common assumptions (e.g. 
having a normal distribution).&nbsp; </p>
<p>In this example, suppose our data array is 7 ones and 3 zeros:</p>
<p>[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]</p>
<p>The main assumption of bootstrapping is that this is a representative sample.&nbsp; 
The first step of bootstrapping is that we resample our original data many 
times.&nbsp; With each resample, we construct a new array with randomly selected 
values from our original data array.&nbsp; We select each element of our 
original array with equal probability for each position of the resample array, 
so the resample will usually contain duplicates and omit values in the original 
array.&nbsp; For our purposes, we'll resample 1,000,000 times:</p>
<p>[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]<br>[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 
1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]<br>[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 
1.0]</p>
<p>... (999,996 resamples omitted) ...</p>
<p>[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]</p>
<p>If we're interested in a statistic, we compute it on each of the resamples.&nbsp; 
In this case, we want to know if the mean value is above .5 with 90% confidence, 
so we compute the mean of each resample:</p>
<p>[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] <span class="style1">® 0.6</span><br>
[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]<span class="style1"> ® 0.9</span><br>
[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] <span class="style1">® 0.8</span></p>
<p>... (999,996 resamples omitted) ...</p>
<p>[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0] <span class="style1">® 0.8</span></p>
<p>Next, we put all of these resample means into an array and sort them:</p>
<p>[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, ... (999,980 resample 
means omitted) ... , 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]</p>
<p>A 90% confidence interval for the mean statistic can then be computed as the 
top and bottom values of the middle 90% of values in this array of resample 
means.&nbsp; Put another way, we look at the values at 5th and 95th percentiles 
(i.e. 5% and 95% of the way through the array).&nbsp; In this case, the resample 
mean values at the 5th and 95th percentiles are 0.5 and 0.9, respectively.&nbsp; 
Because the lower end of this interval (the 5th percentile) is 0.5, indicating 
an even chance of winning or losing, we cannot conclude with 90% confidence that 
a player with 7 out of 10 wins has an advantage.</p>
<p>However, the 15% and 85% percentile values are 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, so 
we could say that we have 70% confidence that the first player has an advantage.</p>
<p>To program the bootstrap technique for this assignment, you are given an 
implementation of percentile lookup in a sorted data array (public static double 
getPercentile(double[] data, double percentile)), but the rest is up to you.&nbsp; 
None of the relevant methods have method bodies that require more than 5 lines 
of code if expressed compactly.</p>

	<li>public static double[] getResample(double[] data)<ul>
		<li>Create a resample array the same length as data.</li>
		<li>For each index of the resample array,<ul>
			<li>assign a random element from the data array.</li>
