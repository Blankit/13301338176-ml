<br><b>Due: Friday 2/3 at the beginning of class</b><p><b>NOTE: Homework that does not compile or is not
submitted according to instructions may receive no credit.</b> Do not forget to 
include your README file (see <a href="hw1.html">HW1</a> for instructions).</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction: </strong>Write a program <tt>Intro.java</tt> that prints four lines with your (1) 
name, (2) year, (3) home town, and (4) reason for taking CS 111. 
<p><strong>2. Escape Characters:</strong> Write a program <tt>EscapeChars.java</tt> that prints the following two 
lines:<pre>This is how you print a double-quote (&quot;), a backslash (\), and a lowercase o with stroke (&#248;).
A tab and a newline are printed using a &quot;\t&quot; and &quot;\n&quot;, respectively.
</pre><p>The unicode value for <strong>lowercase</strong> o with stroke can be 
found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashed_o#Computers">here</a>.
A full reference for Unicode character values can be found
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters">here</a>. 
Remember that a unicode value is represented in a Java String by following a 
backslash (&quot;\&quot;) and &quot;u&quot; with a 4 hexadecimal digit unicode number.<p>
<strong>3. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit:</strong> Text Programming Exercise 2.1 
(p. 69).&nbsp; Call 
your program <tt>CelsiusToFahrenheit.java</tt>.</p>
<p>
<strong>4. Future Investment Value:</strong> Text Programming Exercise 2.21 (p. 
74).&nbsp; Call your 
program <tt>FutureValue.java</tt>. Let the &quot;monthlyInterestRate&quot; be the annual 
interest rate divided by 12. For this exercise, omit fractions of cents, i.e. a 
future dollar values of 1.259829384 would be printed as $1.25.&nbsp; Hint: 
Casting to an int, i.e. &quot;(int)&quot;, throws away fractional parts.&nbsp; How can you 
throw away fractional cents rather than fractional dollars? </p>
