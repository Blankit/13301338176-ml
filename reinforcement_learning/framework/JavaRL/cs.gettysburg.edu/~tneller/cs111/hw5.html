<br><b>Due: Friday 2/24 at the beginning of class<br><span class="style2">
Extended Due Date (due to submission system problem): Friday 3/3 at the 
beginning of class</span></b>
<p><strong>1. Pentagon Area:&nbsp;</strong> Text Programming Exercise 4.1.&nbsp; Call your 
program <tt>PentagonArea.java</tt>.&nbsp; Remember to end your last print 
statement with a newline.</p>

<p><b>2. Gettysburg Student Username:</b>&nbsp; Implement a program 
<tt>Username.java</tt> that prompts the user with &quot;Please enter a first name, last name, 
and 1-2 digit positive integer separated by spaces: &quot;, reads two Strings and an 
integer respectively, and then prints the Gettysburg student username according 
to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The first 4 letters of the username are the lowercase first 4 letters of 
	the last name.&nbsp; If the last name is less than or equal to 4 letters in 
	length, the entire last name is used.</li>
	<li>The next 2 letters of the username are the lowercase first 2 letters of 
	the first name.&nbsp; If the first name has only 1 letter, the entire first 
	name is used.</li>
	<li>The final 2 digits of the username are the given 1-2 digit positive 
	integer.&nbsp; If the input integer has only one digit, a zero is added 
	before that digit.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may assume that all names contain no spaces, hyphens, or any character 
other than an English alphabetic character of either case.&nbsp; You may <em>not</em> 
assume that all input is lowercase.</p>

<p><b>3. Chuck-a-luck:</b> Implement a program ChuckALuck.java that implements a 
simple &quot;Single Die Bet&quot; form of the game Chuck-a-luck.&nbsp; A bettor places a 
stake (i.e. amount of money bet) on a die roll (1-6) and rolls three dice.&nbsp; 
If none of those three show the die roll the stake was bet on, the bettor loses 
their stake.&nbsp; However, if <em>n </em>of the dice rolled equal the die roll 
of the stake, then the banker pays the bettor <em>n</em> to 1, i.e. the bettor 
gets back their stake plus <em>n </em>times their stake.&nbsp; (Thus, a bettor who places a stake 
on 1 and rolls 3,1,4 will get back 2 times their stake back.&nbsp; However, if the 
roll was instead 1,1,1, then the bettor would get back 4 times their stake.)</p>
<p>Input:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The user enters an integer representing their single die number bet.&nbsp; 
	Integers 1-6 are valid entries.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Output:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Initially, the user is prompted for their bet with &quot;Place your bet 
	on a number 1-6: &quot;.</li>
	<li>If the user enters an integer that is not in the range 1-6, the program prints 
	&quot;Invalid bet.&quot; and does nothing more.</li>
	<li>Otherwise, the program prints &quot;Roll: &quot;, and a random number generator simulates 
	three die rolls and prints them separated only by commas (and no spaces).</li>
	<li>The program prints &quot; --&gt; &quot;.</li>
	<li>If the user's bet is not rolled, print &quot;You lose your stake.&quot;</li>
	<li>Otherwise, if the user's bet is rolled <em>n</em> times, print &quot;The 
	banker pays you <em>n</em> to 1!&quot; (substituting the number for <em>n</em>).</li>
	<li>Terminate output with a newline.</li>
