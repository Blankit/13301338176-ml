  <h1> <font size="+2">Collaborative Game Book Writing</font></h1>
  <p> For our fourth hour project this semester, we will 
  collaborate on the writing of a game book together using the same MediaWiki 
  software that underlies Wikipedia.&nbsp; Note that since we do not meet weekly 
  for this fourth hour, your work on this project should be (on average) 3 
  hours/week.&nbsp; Note that some weeks (e.g. research/writing) may take more 
  time whereas other weeks (e.g. revision) will require less.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> In general, for any class hour (including this &quot;fourth hour&quot;), you should 
  budget two additional hours beyond class.&nbsp; Thus, for any 1-credit class, 
  you should expect to work 12 hours per week.&nbsp; In our course, 3 of these 
  are allotted to class time, so the remaining 9 should be distributed between 
  readings, homework, quizzes, exams, and the 4th hour project. </p>
  <p> We will approach the writing in weekly stages.&nbsp; The 
  work of each week will be due at the beginning of each following Tuesday class 
  at 1:10PM.</p>
  <h2> Week 1 (due at the beginning of class #3, 9/5):&nbsp; 
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Wikimedia registration and login, edit and claim game, play and log games.
  </strong></p>
  <ul>
	  <li>Bookmark (but do not share) the address of our course wiki page 
	  (emailed to you at the beginning of the semester).</li>
	  <li>
  	Register yourself on this course wiki with a username that others can easily 
  identify you with. &nbsp;I recommend uppercase camelCase usernames, e.g. 
  FrodoBagginses and ArthurDent.</li>
	  <li>
  	  Follow the link to our wiki page and read the 
  introduction to our semester-long, collaborative game book writing project 
  on the wiki.</li>
	  <li>
  	Explore the different
	  game links and see which games you might most enjoy exploring and writing 
  about.</li>
	  <li>
  	Commit to writing about a game by editing the wiki page with your name to 
	  the right of the game on the first game list. &nbsp;First-come, first-served.</li>
	  <li>
  	our library tutorial session with Kerri Odess-Harnish: Thursday, September 
	  1, from 11:30-12:30 pm in Musselman Library, Room 014. &nbsp;Here, you&#8217;ll learn 
	  many of the skills you&#8217;ll use to research the origins, rules, and 
	  strategies of the game you&#8217;ll be writing about this semester.
</li>
	  <li>
  	Devise a notation to log any moves, chance events, etc. so that you can 
	  effectively reconstruct the game from player notes.</li>
	  <li>
  	Find another player (for non-solitaire games), play your game at least two 
	  times, and log the games using your notation.</li>
	  <li>
  	Bring your game logs to class.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Week 2 (due at the beginning of class #5, 9/12):&nbsp; 
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Research sources for game rules, history, strategy, 
  research, etc. </strong></p>
  <p>Your goal for the semester will be to writing not merely 
  game rules, but to teach the games history, draw the reader into an 
  understanding of the basic strategy and decisions, and excite in the reader a 
  desire to play your game and learn more about it.&nbsp; To this end, your 
  first major step will be to research good sources material.</p>
  <ul>
	  <li>Research sources for game rules, history, strategy, research, etc.&nbsp; 
	  These can include:<ul>
		  <li>Rules others have written for the game</li>
		  <li>Historical information about the game</li>
		  <li>Information about the game's &quot;family&quot;:&nbsp; Which games were the 
		  parents (i.e. design influencers)?&nbsp; Which are closest cousins 
		  (i.e. very similar)?&nbsp; Which are siblings (i.e. variants of the 
		  same game)?</li>
		  <li>Research papers on the game or its close family members (Note: 
		  Sometimes, little has been written about research on the game (e.g. 
		  Jotto), yet there are cousins for which much has been published.&nbsp; 
		  Digesting these can provide surprising insight to your game.)</li>
		  <li>(Note: If you are having difficulty finding sources, first ask 
		  questions of the library staff.&nbsp; If they're stumped, see me for 
		  search tips.)</li>
	  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>After you have dedicated significant time and effort to 
	  gathering research sources, </strong>come to some of my posted office 
	  hours to share what you have found and see if there is anything I would 
	  suggest that you add to your sources.</li>
	  <li>Create the MediaWiki page for your game.&nbsp; (Follow the red link 
	  and save a trivial addition of content to the page in order to start 
	  things off.)</li>
	  <li>Add your sources to your MediaWiki page.&nbsp; Use the 	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Cheatsheet">Wikipedia 
	  cheatsheet</a> to see how to easily add your references.&nbsp; The text 
	  that makes the reference up top can be any placeholder for now.&nbsp; The 
	  bottom reference section, however, should be complete and polished.</li>
	  <li>You will be graded on the quality of this reference section.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Week 3 (due at the beginning of class #7, 9/19):&nbsp; 
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Begin draft of rules, learn wiki authoring and 
  figure creation skills, and add figures to your game page.</strong></p>
  <p>Your first draft (minus the more detailed strategy section) 
  will be due next week, so this week you should:</p>
  <ul>
	  <li>
	  Use the
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Cheatsheet">Wikipedia 
	  cheatsheet</a>,
	  <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Reference_card">MediaWiki 
	  reference card</a>, and any MediaWiki tutorials (e.g.
	  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdoQsFgsOns&amp;list=PLB0168AB327B0FE03">
	  YouTube videos</a>) you may find useful to get comfortable with your basic 
	  wiki authoring skills.	  </li>
	  <li>
	 Begin the first draft on your game rules, history, etc. 
	  without getting into deeper strategy portions.&nbsp; This will likely 
	  suggest figures that will be useful to illustrate your rules.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Become comfortable with software that will enable you to 
	  create high-quality, high-resolution figures to illustrate your game.&nbsp; 
	  You may use and share figure resources you find that have licenses which 
	  allow us free use.&nbsp; This can include licenses that require author 
	  attribution as long as that attribution is made.
	  <ul>
		  <li>
		  One possible route is to become familiar with the 
		  figure-editing features of Microsoft PowerPoint (e.g. insert shape, 
		  edit shape properties, group/ungroup, align, distribute, etc.).&nbsp; 
		  Then one can zoom in on a figure, use the Windows &quot;Snipping Tool&quot; to 
		  grap a partial screenshot, and save it in a common image format.&nbsp; 
		  Avoid compressed formats (e.g. jpg), and prefer uncompressed formats 
		  (e.g. gif, png).
		  </li>
		  <li>
		  All those who are writing about games that share basic materials (e.g. 
		  card games especially) should come to a consensus on the best free 
		  images available for common use.&nbsp; For example, we would want to 
		  avoid having several different card deck image sets in use.&nbsp; 
		  However, one card game writer might use images, and another might have 
		  figures with notation (e.g.
		  <a href="http://www.tmsfeatures.com/columns/bridge/goren-bridge/">
		  Bridge puzzles</a>).&nbsp; Note that there are special
		  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit_(cards)#Character_encodings">
		  characters for card suits</a>.</li>
	  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Create at least two figures in your partial draft that 
	  illustrate your game clearly and attractively.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  You may but are not required to stop by office hours to get feedback on 
	  your figure design.</li>
	  <li>
	  Your partial draft will not be graded at this point.&nbsp; 
	  However, the quality of your draft figures will be graded at this stage.&nbsp;
	  </li>
  </ul>

  </b>
  <h2> Week 4 (due at the beginning of class #9, 9/26):&nbsp; 
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Complete your first draft of game rules and history.</strong></p>
  <ul>
	  <li>This will be your first draft of all except the major portion where 
	  you teach an appreciation for some of your game's strategy.</li>
	  <li>You should effectively use figures and/or examples to clearly 
	  illustrate the rules of your game.</li>
	  <li>This will be peer-reviewed and refined over the coming weeks, but each 
	  draft should be well-polished.&nbsp; Trivial mispellings or grammatical 
	  errors should not be left to the reviewers.&nbsp; Reviewer focus should be 
	  on the clarity and ease of engaging the game through the writing.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Week 5 (due at the beginning of class #11, 10/3):&nbsp; </h2>
  <p><strong>Review the work of three other students, and offer at least 
  <span class="style2">three</span> specific and concrete suggestions to improve the writing of each. 
  Seek further revision feedback on your writing from the
  <a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/english/student/writing-center.dot">
  Writing Center</a>.</strong></p>
  <ul>
	  <li>You will review the next three students on the game list on our course 
	  wiki page (wrapping around the end as necessary).&nbsp; You'll skip over 
	  the &quot;Pig&quot; entry (mine used to provide examples). </li>
	  <li>Your suggestions will be entered under the Discuss tab of each page 
	  you review and you'll sign your suggestions using the &quot;~~~~&quot; 
	  auto-signature feature.&nbsp; (Try it!)</li>
	  <li><strong>Specific</strong> and <strong>concrete</strong> suggestions:<ul>
		  <li>Don&#8217;t say &#8220;fix some grammatical errors&#8221;; quote specific errors and 
		  provide suggested corrections. </li>
		  <li>Don&#8217;t say &#8220;add more figures&#8221;; suggest specific figures that would 
		  be helpful and explain why. </li>
		  <li>Don&#8217;t say &#8220;include references&#8221;; suggest what specifically needs to 
		  be referenced and include a reference if possible.</li>
		  <li>Provide the help you would want in their place to improve the 
		  writing.</li>
		  <li>While praise is great to include as encouragement, note that it 
		  does not constitute a concrete suggestion for improvement. </li>
		  <li>Even well written material can be improved. &nbsp;Suggestions of 
		  improved rephrasings, requests for helpful examples of difficult 
		  concepts, and descriptions of misunderstandings when reading are all 
		  helpful feedback. </li>
		  <li><em>Remember to review your writing to see that you've provided at 
		  least three specific and concrete suggestions for writing improvement.</em></li>
	  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Follow the
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">Golden Rule</a> of 
	  reviewing: Offer constructive criticism just as you would want 
	  constructive criticism offered to you.<ul>
		  <li>Suggest improvements, but bear in mind that it is<em> their</em> 
		  work, not yours.</li>
		  <li>Praise what is praiseworthy, and suggest possible improvements 
		  with gentle language.&nbsp; I've heard it said that &quot;criticism is 
		  heard at three times the volume of praise.&quot;&nbsp; This doesn't 
		  mean you should avoid criticism; rather, you should express criticism 
		  with care.</li>
		  <li>Use &quot;I&quot; language to approach difficult observations.&nbsp; 
		  Good example: &quot;I found the prose to be very clear and helpful up to 
		  ____ paragraph.&nbsp; I then found it difficult to parse ____ lines 
		  and understand rule _____.&nbsp; The following paragraphs and examples made 
		  this rule clear, but I believe these lines can be improved.&nbsp; Here's 
		  one possible revision: _____&quot;&nbsp; Bad example: &quot;I found 
		  your rules unclear. Revise.&quot;</li>
		  <li>Offer your observations in a spirit of generous helpfulness.&nbsp; 
		  Again, treat others as you would want to be treated in a review 
		  process.</li>
	  </ul>
	  </li>
  	<li>Get direct verbal feedback on your writing from a volunteer of the 
	  Writing Center as early in week 5 as possible.&nbsp; The <strong>
	  <a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/english/student/writing-center.dot">
	  Writing Center</a></strong> is on the <strong>ground floor of Breidenbaugh 
	  Hal</strong>l and is staffed with student volunteers <strong>
	  Sunday-Thursday from 4-10PM.&nbsp; </strong>(The student writing tutors 
	  will complete paperwork on your Writing Center visit which will result in 
	  an email to me verifying your participation in this step.)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Week 6 (due at the beginning of class #13, 10/12):&nbsp; </h2>
  <p><strong>Read your reviews, revise, and add at least 2 examples of strategic 
  gameplay with figures.</strong></p>
  <ul>
	  <li>The application of the
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">Golden Rule</a> to 
	  reading and acting on reviews consists of multiple facets:<ul>
		  <li>First, assume that the reviewer is seeking to be helpful.&nbsp; Do 
		  not assume antagonism when receiving suggestions for change to your 
		  writing.&nbsp; You have a common purpose with the reviewer: Both of 
		  you want your prose to be as polished and effective as possible.&nbsp; 
		  You're on the same side.</li>
		  <li>Second, do not quickly jump to your own defense.&nbsp; &quot;I thought 
		  my original phrasing was far superior to my reviewer's suggested 
		  revision!&quot;&nbsp; Begin with the humble assumption that your prose will 
		  not be everything to everyone, and that alternative perspective are 
		  valuable in aiding you to effectively communicate most broadly. </li>
		  <li>Look keenly for deeper insight to possible improvements when 
		  others see the possibility.&nbsp; If something even hints of lack of 
		  clarity, verbosity, or other writing weaknesses, embrace the challenge 
		  of change and improvement.&nbsp; With reflective practice, you will 
		  improve as a writer.</li>
	  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Next, add at least two play strategy examples or puzzles with figures.&nbsp; 
	  Your purpose here is to show <em>why</em> the game is interesting.&nbsp; 
	  Rules alone are inadequate to unfold a game to the reader.&nbsp; Well 
	  chosen examples can really draw the reader into the game.&nbsp; This is 
	  where you have the best chance to really make your game appeal to the 
	  reader.&nbsp; Remember that your goal is to have a general audience reader 
	  become interested in the game and desire to play it, furthering their 
	  understanding and appreciation.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Week 7 (due at the beginning of class #15, 10/19):&nbsp; </h2>
  <p><strong>Review the revisions and additions of the <em>next</em> three  
  games on the class list.&nbsp; Seek further revision feedback on your writing 
  from the
  <a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/english/student/writing-center.dot">
  Writing Center</a>.</strong></p>
  <ul>
	  <li>Follow the same procedure as week 5, but review the next three games 
	  after the ones you reviewed in week 5 on the list (skipping Pig and wrapping around the end).&nbsp; Again, sign 
	  your work with &quot;~~~~&quot; and preview to make sure your auto-signature 
	  reflects your user ID, time, etc.</li>
	  <li>Create a new &quot;Phase 2 Review&quot; heading under the Discuss tab to 
	  separate older reviews from newer reviews.</li>
	  <li>Continue to practice the application of the 	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">Golden Rule</a> to 
	  reviewing.</li>
	  <li>Get direct verbal feedback on your writing from a volunteer of the 
	  Writing Center as early in week 7 as possible.&nbsp; The <strong>
	  <a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/english/student/writing-center.dot">
	  Writing Center</a></strong> is on the <strong>ground floor of Breidenbaugh 
	  Hal</strong>l and is staffed with student volunteers <strong>
	  Sunday-Thursday from 4-10PM.&nbsp; </strong>(The student writing tutors 
	  will complete paperwork on your Writing Center visit which will result in 
	  an email to me verifying your participation in this step.)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Week 8 (due at the beginning of class #17, 10/26):&nbsp; </h2>
  <p><strong>Read your new reviews, revise again, and add at a &quot;For Further 
  Reading&quot; section.</strong></p>
  <ul>
	  <li>Read your new reviews and create a third draft of your game rules.&nbsp; 
	  You are nearing the final draft, so take special care to polish your 
	  prose.&nbsp; Come back to it again and again with fresh eyes.&nbsp; Again, 
	  imagine yourself as a reader who is entirely unfamiliar with any aspect of 
	  your game, and ask yourself &quot;Could I clearly understand how to play this 
	  without additional references?&quot; </li>
	  <li>Add a &#8220;For Further Reading&#8221; section.&nbsp; In many cases, 
	  there will be favorite references or even unused references that are 
	  interesting but are beyond the scope of your writing.&nbsp; This is a 
	  section where you recommend to your reader where they would best learn 
	  more about your game.<ul>
		  <li>In the case where references are few for your game, you can see me 
		  for suggestions, or you can suggest more general reading about related 
		  games.</li>
		  <li>Each recommendation should come with an explanation of why you 
		  recommend the reading and what the reader could expect to gain from 
		  reading it.</li>
	  </ul>
	  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Week 9 (due at the beginning of class #19, 11/2):&nbsp; </h2>
  <p><strong>Review the revisions and additions of the <em>next</em> three  
  games on the class list.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek further revision feedback from the
  <a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/english/student/writing-center.dot">
  Writing Center</a>.</strong></p>
  <ul>
	  <li>Review rules and examples of the next 3 games on the list after the 
	  ones you reviewed in week 7.</li>
	  <li>Discuss tab entry of reviews under &#8220;Review Phase 3&#8221; heading.</li>
	  <li>This is the final review cycle, so be sure to help your peer with as 
	  many final polishing edit suggestions as possible.</li>
	  <li>Get direct verbal feedback on your writing from a volunteer of the 
	  Writing Center as early in week 9 as possible.&nbsp; The <strong>
	  <a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/english/student/writing-center.dot">

	  will complete paperwork on your Writing Center visit which will result in 
	  an email to me verifying your participation in this step.)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Week 10 (due at the beginning of class #21, 11/9):</h2>
  <p><strong>Read your new reviews, and revise your final draft. </strong></p>
  <ul>
	  <li>This is the time to make your article a finished product.&nbsp; At 
	  this point:<ul>
		  <li>You should have the good observations of 9 reviewers.</li>
		  <li>Your prose should be an excellent standalone introduction to your 
		  game.</li>
		  <li>Your reader should ideally get a rudimentary feel for the game and 
		  be motivated to play it!</li>
		  <li>Your figures should be well-polished, sized appropriately, and 
		  look good in print.&nbsp; (Try printing the webpage to a PDF file to 
		  get a sense of it.)</li>
	  </ul>
	  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Week 11 (due at the beginning of class #23, 11/16):</h2>
  <ul>
	  <li>Prepare a 5-minute PPT presentation of your game and post slides on 
	  our wiki index page:<ul>
		  <li>Add your presentation using the Upload File option on the left 
		  bar.&nbsp; This will allow upload of files with common presentation 
		  extensions: ppt, pptx, odp, fodp, and pdf.&nbsp; If there&#8217;s another common 
		  presentation extension that you need that I have not included, please 
		  let me know.</li>
		  <li>To the right of your name in the game index, edit and add and the 
		  following thereafter: 
		  ([[media:yourUploadedFilenameHere|presentation]])&nbsp; (substituting your 
		  uploaded filename for the yourUploadedFilenameHere text, of course).
		  </li>
	  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>[My task: Distribute PDF book, all read remainder of book and check on prior 
	  review recommendation implementations]</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Week 12 (due at the beginning of class #25, 11/28):</h2>
  <ul>
	  <li>Suggest at least 3 improvements to PDF book via email. These may be 
	  concrete edit suggestions for individual articles, or concrete suggestions 
	  for PDF book generation, but should be focused on what would most improve 
	  our final game book. </li>
	  <li>I will bring these together into a single email I will send to the 
	  class (with feedback anonymous this time).</li>
	  <li>This will serve all of us for final game book revisions next week.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Week 13 (due at the beginning of class #27, 12/5):</h2>
  <ul>
	  <li>Presentations for all games at Game Club (Tuesday evening, 8-9:30PM, 
	  11/29, Glatfelter 104) </li>
	  <li>Make final revisions to wiki for PDF book final draft</li>
	  <li>(The final draft of the PDF book will be generated and distributed before 
  the last class #28, 12/18.)</li>
