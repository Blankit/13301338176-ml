<h1> Why Games?</h1>
  <p><em>Brief comments on the recreation, exploration, and observation of art, 
  beauty, and truth of games.</em></p>
  Why do people play, create, and research games?&nbsp; What is it about games 
  that continues to attract the attention of researchers in Artificial 
  Intelligence (AI) and Recreational Mathematics?&nbsp; Here are a few thoughts 
  to spark a larger conversation on why games represent both an important area 
  of cultural study and a foundational pursuit of the understanding of humans 
  and reason.<h2>The Recreation of Games</h2>
  <p>Just as sports offer fun, competitive exercise of the body, games offer 
  fun, competitive exercise of the mind.&nbsp; Party games (e.g. Charades, the 
  Dictionary Game / Balderdash, Pictionary) often exercise skills of creative 
  communication.&nbsp; Trivia games exercise the recall of&nbsp; broad, common 
  knowledge.&nbsp; Many board, card, and dice games exercise our deepest 
  reasoning and memory skills and ability to model those of our opponent.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Although &quot;recreation&quot; is often associated with the word &quot;leisure&quot;, leisure 
  often has an aspect of ease or lack of activity, whereas recreation is often 
  defined as &quot;activity done for enjoyment when one is not working&quot;.&nbsp; Put 
  another way, recreation is playful work we opt to do.&nbsp; As my mother would 
  say, &quot;Vacation isn't doing nothing. Vacation is doing something different.&quot;&nbsp; 
  In our recreational gameplay, we exercise aspects of our humanity (creativity, 
  problem solving, communication, etc.) when we don't need to simply because we 
  enjoy them.&nbsp; As the athlete enjoys the healthy functioning of the active 
  body, the gamer enjoys the healthy functioning of an active mind. </p>
  <h2>The Exploration of Games</h2>
  <p>Many games can be thought of as carefully crafted microworlds, inviting 
  gamers to explore the complex terrain that can spring into existence from even 
  simple rules.&nbsp; There are few dice games with simpler rules than those of
  <a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/piggame.html">Pig</a>, yet the
  <a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/pigVis.html">boundary</a> 
  between situations where one should roll or hold, continuing or ending one's 
  turn, is like a complex alien landscape with a wave crashing over rolling 
  dunes.</p>
  <p>Physicists have long pursued a mathematical model that describes all 
  physical behaviors of our universe.&nbsp; A
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything">theory of 
  everything</a> is an eagerly pursued dream.&nbsp; A game is a micro-universe 
  where the rules define the dynamics and the gamer has a hope of playfully 
  unfolding the mysteries of a new world.&nbsp; Gamers are explorers, 
  experiencing discovery and charting new landscapes with each play, formulating 
  hypotheses of how to best navigate the landscape towards the realm of Victory, 
  and empirically supporting and refuting such hypotheses.</p>
  <p>Beyond the game-level pursuit of optimality, games can offer insight to the 
  opponent's intellect and personality.&nbsp; We come to know each other better 
  through games. </p>
  <p class="style2">&quot;If you would read a mans Disposition, see him Game, you 
  will then learn more of him in one hour, than in seven Years Conversation, 
  ...&quot; - <a href="https://archive.org/details/aletterofadvicet00linguoft">
  Richard Lingard</a>.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>As one who cares to know others better, observe how other players play, 
  especially at the meta-level: how they handle victory and defeat, how they 
  treat other players, how they react to risks and rewards, and whether they 
  value other gamers over the game itself as evidenced through gracious words, 
  considerate use of decision time, and a thousand little opportunities to 
  express value for other players.&nbsp; Never win the game at the expense of 
  losing the metagame; play your best at the game while treating other players 
  as precious friends.&nbsp; How well you treat your opponents is a deep 
  expression of character. </p>
  <h2>The Art, Beauty, and Truth of Games</h2>
  <p>A good game design is a thing of beauty, inviting appreciative observation.&nbsp; 
  Artful design gives rise to interesting balances that must be maintained 
  between risk and reward, short-term and long-term ramifications, and 
  cooperation and antagonism with opponents within the game.&nbsp; The simple 
  rules of many deep games (e.g. Go) give rise to patterns of play and reason 
  that have a beauty not unlike a beautiful phrase of music or intricate 
  sculpture.&nbsp; What is even more surprising and delightful in my experience 
  is how one can find morals in games that transcend games and speak Truth.&nbsp; 
  To modify
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+8%3A36&amp;version=KJV">
  Mark 8:36</a> for Chess: &quot;For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the 
  whole material advantage, and lose his own king?&quot; </p>
  <p>Many games offer shallow (and even often good) evidences of winning 
  potential that are not the same as real winning potential.&nbsp; The deep 
  strategist sees beneath the surface advantage to the true utilities within the 
  game, sometimes offering seeming sacrifices for a greater, deeper advantage.&nbsp; 
  Many &quot;economic&quot;-style games offer short-term scoring gain at the expense of 
  long-term scoring gain, rewarding delayed gratification.&nbsp; Discernment of 
  a proper time to value each element of the game is reminiscent of
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3&amp;version=KJV">
  Ecclesiates 3</a>.&nbsp; In jeopardy games, we learn that to win more often 
  means being willing to lose more spectacularly.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The astute observer of games can extrapolate from the truths of these 
  microworlds to the Truths of our world.&nbsp; As we play, we are invited to 
  become Philosopher-Gamers.</p>
  <h2>What Do You See in Games?</h2>
  <p>If you have also come to appreciate the joy of game recreation, the 
  exploration of game microworlds, and the art, beauty, and truth of games, I 
  would appreciate the opportunity to read and consider your insights as well.</p>
