<h3 class="style1"> Course Overview</h3>
  <span class="style1">This seminar is a computational look at a variety of games, focusing mainly on combinatorial games (e.g. Chess), games of chance (e.g. Backgammon), and games of imperfect information (e.g. Poker).  Students will come to understand not only how we mathematically model such games, but also how we compute optimal (or approximately optimal) play for such games.  Sophocles wrote, &#8220;One must learn by doing the thing; for though you think you know it, you have no certainty, until you try.&#8221;  Thus, students will not merely read about game-playing techniques from fields such as Game Theory and Artificial Intelligence, but will also apply them through both handwritten and computer programming exercises.  No prior programming experience is necessary; students will be introduced to simple programming languages and techniques as part of the course.  By the completion of the course, students will understand the fundamentals for reasoning about many games, gain a sense of how the computer can serve as a power tool for the mind, and experience the joy of discovering new and deep insights into the artificial micro-worlds of games.
<h3> Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Gain the ability to mathematically model combinatorial games, games of 
	chance, and games of imperfect information.</li>
	<li>Learn basic algorithms for reasoning about the play of combinatorial 
	games, games of chance, and games of imperfect information.</li>
	<li>Develop a greater ability to verbally communicate game specifications, 
	and utilize the computer as a tool to yield insights to game 
	play.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Grading</h3>
  70% Assignments <br>15% Game Book Writing (4th Hour Requirement)<br>
10% Quizzes / Exams <br>
5% Class Attendance / Participation 
<p>You are responsible to know the material from each lecture and reading 
assignment before the start of the next class.&nbsp; Homework is due <b>at 
the beginning of lecture on the due date.</b>&nbsp; Late homework will not
necessarily be accepted.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Class attendance and participation is
required.&nbsp; If you attend all classes and are willing to
participate, you'll get 100% for this part of your grade.&nbsp; Even if
you know enough to give a particular lecture, please consider the value
of helping your peers
during in-class exercises. </p>
<p>Woody Allen is quoted as saying
<a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/06/10/showing-up/">&quot;80% of success is 
just showing up.&quot;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; While our class attendance/participation grade 
is not 80% of the final grade, it is critical that late arrivals and unexcused 
absences are not excessive.&nbsp; Missing more than half of class unexcused is 
considered being absent.&nbsp; An unexcused late arrival is counted as a half 
absence.&nbsp; <strong>If the total number of absences counted this way exceeds 
20% of class meetings, i.e. 8.5 absences or more, the student will have failed 
the course.</strong>&nbsp; </p>
<h3> Work Time Expectations</h3>
  <p> College policy on work expectations: <strong>&#8220;Each course should claim an 
  average of 12 hours of student time per week (four class hours and eight hours 
  of preparation or homework) over the course of the semester.</strong>&#8221; 
  (source:
  <a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/dotAsset/43b5a59c-ffc7-44b7-9893-1a7f5302e6c1.pdf">
  http://www.gettysburg.edu/dotAsset/43b5a59c-ffc7-44b7-9893-1a7f5302e6c1.pdf</a>) 
  Since our course meets only 3 hours (the fourth class hour being replaceable 
  by an approved fourth hour project beyond the classroom), this means that all 
  assigned readings, assignments, and game book writing should take an average 
  of 9 hours beyond the classroom per week. My goal is to help you learn the 
  best, most up-to-date, high-utility material on games and computation within 
  that time budget. &nbsp;If you happen to be doing more than 9 hours of work on FYS 
  187-4 outside of class on average, please meet with me so I can help 
  understand and help you work towards the intended time budget. </p>
  <h3> Honor Code</h3>
Honesty, Integrity, Honor.&nbsp; These are more important than anything
we will teach in this class.&nbsp; Students can and are encouraged to help
each other understand course concepts, but all graded work must be done
independently unless otherwise specified (e.g. group work).&nbsp; Submitted work 
should be created by those submitting it.&nbsp; Submission 
of plagiarized code or design work is a violation of the Honor Code, which I 
strictly enforce.&nbsp; For
detailed information about the Honor Code, see
<a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot">
http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot</a>.
<p>What is permitted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Discussing algorithms, syntax, and problem specifications with other 
	students</li>
	<li>Seeking assistance (as needed) from CS professors, students assistants, 
	and approved tutors</li>
	<li>Use of &quot;starter code&quot; supplied by your professor, or code you have 
	previously developed</li>
</ul>
<p>What is not permitted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sharing code: Verbal dictation of code, transference of code (e.g. 
	e-mail, file transfer, entry of printed output, etc.).&nbsp; An important 
	component of this experiential learning process is developing the ability to 
	independently devise algorithms and express them in program code.</li>
	<li>Viewing and/or using unauthorized code (e.g. solutions found online, 
	downloads from code repositories, etc.)</li>
	<li>Submitting work that implicitly takes credit for work that should be 
	credited to others</li>
	<li>Efforts to obscure the source of unauthorized work</li>
	<li>Outsourcing work</li>
</ul>
<p>Put simply, students may discuss assignments at an abstract level (e.g. 
specifications, algorithm pseudocode), but must actually implement solutions 
independently or in permitted groups.&nbsp; Credit should be given where credit 
is due.&nbsp; Let your conscience be your guide.&nbsp; Do not merely focus on 
the result; learn from the process.</span></p>
