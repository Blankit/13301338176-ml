<h1>Average Pig Turns</h1>
<p><b><a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/">Pig</a></b> is a folk jeopardy dice game with simple rules: Two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a 
player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 (&quot;pig&quot;) is rolled or the player holds and 
scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the <i>turn total</i>). At any time during a 
player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>roll</b> - If the player rolls a 
	<ul>
		<li><b>1</b>: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's 
		turn. 
		</li>
		<li><b>2 - 6</b>: the number is added to the player's turn total and the 
		player's turn continues. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>hold</b> - The turn total is added to the player's score and it 
	becomes the opponent's turn. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Problem:</b> What is the expected number of turns per 
solitaire game with a hold-at-20-or-goal play policy?&nbsp; Simulate a given 
number of solitaire Pig games where a player rolls until a 1 
(&quot;pig&quot;) is rolled, or the turn total is greater than or equal to 20, 
or the score plus the turn total is greater than or equal to 100.&nbsp; Report 
the average number of turns per game.</p>
<p><b>Input Format:</b>&nbsp; Enter a single positive integer indicating the number of 
games simulated.&nbsp; (Larger numbers will tend to yield better estimations.)</p>
<p><b>Output Format:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Initially, prompt the user with &quot;Games? &quot;.</li>
	<li>After the simulations, print &quot;Average turns: &quot; followed by the average 
	turns taken per simulated game.</li>
</ul>

<p>Highlight the transcript in the space immediately below to check your result 
(your approximation will vary in latter decimal places): </p>

<p><b>Common Error:&nbsp; </b>When creating nested loops, perform loop 
initialization directly before the relevant loop.&nbsp; Note:</p>
<p>&lt;loop 1 initialization&gt;<br>
&lt;loop 1&gt; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;loop 2 initialization&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;loop 2&gt; </p>
<p>is <i>not </i>the same as</p>
<p>&lt;loop 1 initialization&gt;<br>
&lt;loop 2 initialization&gt;<br>
&lt;loop 1&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;loop 2&gt; </p>
<p>In the latter case, &lt;loop 2&gt; is not properly initialized each time.</p>
<!--<p><b>4. Text Diamond: </b>Exercise 5.24.&nbsp; Call your program <tt>Diamond.java</tt>.&nbsp; If you need an optional warm-up exercise, consider 5.15.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hint: One possible solution uses two nested for repetitions, a single if decision, and three print statements (one each for '*', ' ', and newline).</p><p>Extra credit (10%): Generalize your program to prompt the user for an odd positive integer <i>n</i> and produce an <i>n</i>-by-<i>n</i> diamond shape.</p><pre>
