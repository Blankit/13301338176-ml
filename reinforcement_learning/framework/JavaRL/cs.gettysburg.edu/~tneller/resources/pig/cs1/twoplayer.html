<h1>Two-Player Pig</h1>
<p><b><a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/">Pig</a></b> is a folk jeopardy dice game with simple rules: Two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a 
player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 (&quot;pig&quot;) is rolled or the player holds and 
scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the <i>turn total</i>). At any time during a 
player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>roll</b> - If the player rolls a 
	<ul>
		<li><b>1</b>: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's 
		turn. 
		</li>
		<li><b>2 - 6</b>: the number is added to the player's turn total and the 
		player's turn continues. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>hold</b> - The turn total is added to the player's score and it 
	becomes the opponent's turn. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Problem:</b>&nbsp; Simulate a single solitaire game of Pig where a player rolls until a 1 
(&quot;pig&quot;) is rolled, or the turn total is greater than or equal to 20, 
or the score plus the turn total is greater than or equal to 100.</p>
<p> <i>Note: Be sure to &quot;factor out common code&quot;.&nbsp; There is no reason to 
have two separate, nearly identical sections of code for each player's turn. </i>
</p>
<p><b>Input Format:</b>&nbsp; (no input)</p>
<p><b>Output Format:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Before each turn, print a line with &quot;Player 1 score: &quot; and player 1's 
	score.&nbsp; Print another line with &quot;Player 2 score: &quot; and player 2's 
	score.&nbsp; Finally, print a line with &quot;It is player #'s turn.&quot;, where &quot;#&quot; 
	is replaced by the current player number.&nbsp; Play starts with player 1 
	and then alternates.</li>
	<li>For each roll, print a line with &quot;Roll: &quot; and the random die roll value 
	(1-6).</li>
	<li>After a &quot;pig&quot; roll of 1, or a &quot;hold&quot;, print a line with &quot;Turn 
	total: &quot; 
	followed by the turn total.&nbsp; In the case of a &quot;pig&quot;, this 
	turn total 
	is 0.&nbsp; Then, print a line with &quot;New score: &quot; followed by the new score 
	for the current player.</li>
</ul>
