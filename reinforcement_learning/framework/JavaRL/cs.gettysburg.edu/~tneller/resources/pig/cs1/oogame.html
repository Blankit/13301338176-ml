<h1>O-O Pig Game</h1>
<p><b><a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/">Pig</a></b> is a folk jeopardy dice game with simple rules: Two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a 
player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 (&quot;pig&quot;) is rolled or the player holds and 
scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the <i>turn total</i>). At any time during a 
player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>roll</b> - If the player rolls a 
	<ul>
		<li><b>1</b>: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's 
		turn. 
		</li>
		<li><b>2 - 6</b>: the number is added to the player's turn total and the 
		player's turn continues. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>hold</b> - The turn total is added to the player's score and it 
	becomes the opponent's turn. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Problem:</b>&nbsp; Create an object-oriented implementation of a game of Pig where the user plays against a 
&quot;hold at 20 or goal&quot; computer player that rolls until a 1 
(&quot;pig&quot;) is rolled, or the turn total is greater than or equal to 20, 
or the score plus the turn total is greater than or equal to 100.&nbsp; The 
first player is chosen randomly.</p>
<p> <b>O-O Design Constraints:</b></p>
<p> BlueJ UML diagram:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="ooPig.png" width="399" height="255"></p>
<p>Although one need not implement in Java, the object-oriented specification is 
supplied via <a href="doc/index.html">HTML Javadoc documentation</a>.&nbsp; The 
global input/output specification is given here:</p>
<p><b>Input Format:</b>&nbsp; An empty input (i.e., Enter) indicates that the 
user wishes to roll.&nbsp; Any entered line of non-zero length indicates that 
the user wishes to hold.</p>
<p><b>Output Format:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Before the game, randomly select which player the user will be, and 
	print the line &quot;You will be player #.&quot;, where # is the user's player number. 
	Then, print an instruction line &quot;Enter nothing to roll; enter anything to hold.&quot;</li>
	<li>Before each turn, print a line with &quot;Player 1 score: &quot; and player 1's 
	score.&nbsp; Print another line with &quot;Player 2 score: &quot; and player 2's 
	score.&nbsp; Finally, print a line with &quot;It is player #'s turn.&quot;, where &quot;#&quot; 
	is replaced by the current player number.&nbsp; Play starts with player 1 
	and then alternates.</li>
	<li>For each roll, print a line with &quot;Roll: &quot; and the random die roll value 
	(1-6).</li>
	<li>For each non-&quot;pig&quot; roll 2-6 on the user's turn, prompt the user with 
	&quot;Turn total: &quot;, the turn total, a tab, and &quot;Roll/Hold? &quot;.</li>
	<li>After a &quot;pig&quot; roll of 1, or a &quot;hold&quot;, print a line with &quot;Turn 
	total: &quot; 
	followed by the turn total.&nbsp; In the case of a &quot;pig&quot;, this 
	turn total 
	is 0.&nbsp; Then, print a line with &quot;New score: &quot; followed by the new score 
	for the current player.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Extra Exercises:</b></p>
<p>1. Use an alternative computer play policy.&nbsp; Let <i>i </i>be the player's score,<i> j</i> 
be the opponent's score, and <i>k</i> be the current turn total.<i>&nbsp; </i>
Some alternative play policies:</p>
<ul>
	<li><u>Hold at 25 or goal</u> - Hold at the lesser of 25 and 100 - i.</li>
	<li><u>4 Scoring Turns</u> - Let <i>t</i> be the number of turns in which a 
	player has held so far.&nbsp; Hold at floor((100 - i)/(4 - t)).</li>
	<li><u>Score Base, Keep Pace, and End Race</u> - If <i>i</i> &gt;= 69 or <i>j</i> 
	&gt;= 69, roll for the goal.&nbsp; Otherwise, hold at the greater of 19 and <i>
	j</i> - 14.</li>
	<li><u>Keep Pace and End Race</u> - If <i>i</i> &gt;= 71 or <i>j</i> &gt;= 71, 
	roll for the goal.&nbsp; Otherwise, hold at 21 + round((<i>j</i> - <i>i</i>) 
	/ 8).</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Allow play of multiple games, alternating the starting player and 
computing win statistics.</p>
