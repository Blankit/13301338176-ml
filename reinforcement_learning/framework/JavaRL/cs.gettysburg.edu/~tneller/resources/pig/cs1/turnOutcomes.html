<h1>Hold-at-20 Outcomes (Computation)</h1>
<p><b><a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/">Pig</a></b> is a folk jeopardy dice game with simple rules: Two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a 
player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 (&quot;pig&quot;) is rolled or the player holds and 
scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the <i>turn total</i>). At any time during a 
player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>roll</b> - If the player rolls a 
	<ul>
		<li><b>1</b>: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's 
		turn. 
		</li>
		<li><b>2 - 6</b>: the number is added to the player's turn total and the 
		player's turn continues. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>hold</b> - The turn total is added to the player's score and it 
	becomes the opponent's turn. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Problem:</b>&nbsp; Compute and report the 
probabilities of the possible scoring outcomes from a hold-at-20 Pig turn.</p>
<p>The following is a dynamic programming algorithm that approaches the problem 
by computing the probability of passing through each score on the way to the 
final outcome:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a floating-point array <i>score</i> with indices from 0 through 25 
	(hold value + 5).&nbsp; 
	Initialize all entries to 0.0, except initialize index 0 to 1.0.</li>
	<li>For each increasing index <i>i</i> from 0 through 19 (hold value - 1):</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Let <i>p</i> be<i> score</i>[<i>i</i>]<i> </i>/ 6<i>.</i></li>
		<li>Set <i>score</i>[<i>i</i>] to 0.0.</li>
		<li>Add p to <i>score</i>[0], <i>score</i>[<i>i </i>+ 2], <i>score</i>[<i>i
		</i>+ 3],&nbsp; <i>score</i>[<i>i </i>+ 4],&nbsp; <i>score</i>[<i>i </i>
		+ 5],&nbsp; <i>score</i>[<i>i </i>+ 6]</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>At the beginning of each iteration <i>i,</i>&nbsp; <i>score</i>[<i>i</i>] is 
the probability of passing through score <i>i.</i>&nbsp; After all iterations, 
the remaining positive values are the probabilities of their respective score 
outcome probabilities.</p>
<p><b>Input Format:</b>&nbsp; (no input)</p>
<p><b>Output Format:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>On the first line, print &quot;Score&quot; and &quot;Probability&quot; separated by 
	a tab.</li>
	<li>After computing the probabilities of outcomes, print a table line for each possible score 
	outcome in increasing order of score.&nbsp; For each score outcome, print 
	the score, a tab, and the probability of that score outcome.</li>
</ul>

<pre>Score   Probability
0       0.624541
20      0.099713
21      0.094991
22      0.074189

<p><b>Extra Exercises: </b></p>
<ol>
	<li>What is the expected average score outcome for hold-at-20?</li>
	<li>Additionally allow the user to specify the hold value.&nbsp; What is the 
	probability of reaching 100 in a single turn? </li>
