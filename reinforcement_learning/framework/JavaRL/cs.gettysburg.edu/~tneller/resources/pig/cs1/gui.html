<h1>Pig Game GUI</h1>
<p><b><a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/projects/pig/">Pig</a> </b> is a folk jeopardy dice game with simple rules: Two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a 
player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 (&quot;pig&quot;) is rolled or the player holds and 
scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the <i>turn total</i>). At any time during a 
player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>roll</b> - If the player rolls a 
	<ul>
		<li><b>1</b>: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's 
		turn. 
		</li>
		<li><b>2 - 6</b>: the number is added to the player's turn total and the 
		player's turn continues. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>hold</b> - The turn total is added to the player's score and it 
	becomes the opponent's turn. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Problem:</b>&nbsp; Implement a GUI for the game of Pig where the user plays 
a succession of games against a computer player.&nbsp; A brief summary of 
software requirements follows.</p>
<h2><img border="0" src="screenshot.png" width="160" height="314" align="right">Overview</h2>
<p>Your goal is to create a simple-yet-fun GUI implementation of the game of 
Pig.&nbsp; The user is the starting player of the first game.&nbsp; The 
starting player alternates with successive games.&nbsp; The computer plays a 
&quot;Keep Pace and End Race&quot; policy as follows:&nbsp; Let the hold value be 21 + round((user score - computer score) / 8).&nbsp; If either player has 71 points 
or more, or if the turn total is less than the hold value, then roll.&nbsp; 
Otherwise, hold.</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p><a href="images/allImages.zip">Image files</a> are supplied in
<a href="images/png">PNG</a> and <a href="images/jpg">JPEG</a> formats.</p>
<h2>Graphical User Interface Components</h2>
<p>Main application frame titled &quot;Pig&quot;, terminating program on close, and 
containing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>&quot;Your Score:&quot; label - fixed text label</li>
	<li>Your score value label - should update to reflect changes in user score</li>
	<li>&quot;My Score:&quot; label - fixed text label</li>
	<li>My score value label - should update to reflect changes in computer 
	score</li>
	<li>&quot;Turn Total:&quot; label - fixed text label</li>
	<li>Turn total value label - should update to reflect changes in turn total</li>
	<li>Die panel - area for displaying 100-by-100 die images, and roll/hold 
	images</li>
	<li>&quot;Roll&quot; button - enabled during user turn to trigger Roll Action</li>
	<li>&quot;Hold&quot; button - enabled during user turn to trigger Hold Action</li>
	<li>Pop-up window with:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Game over text label - provides winner, final score, and prompts 
		user with new game decision.</li>
		<li>&quot;New Game&quot; button - triggers New Game Action</li>
		<li>&quot;Quit&quot; button - exits application</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>For the most part, layout is not specified.&nbsp; However, the related 
label-value label pairs should be horizontally adjacent with the label to the 
left of the value label.</p>
<h2>Functional Specification</h2>
<h3>Initialization</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Create and layout all GUI components with the exception of the pop-up 
	window.</li>
	<li>Set both scores and turn total to 0.</li>
	<li>Display the &quot;roll&quot; image in the die panel.</li>
	<li>Set the starting player to the user.</li>
	<li>Set the current player to the user.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Roll Button </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Enable roll button during user turn.</li>
	<li>On roll button press, trigger Roll Action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Roll Action</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Generate a random number <i>r</i> in the range [1, 6].</li>
	<li>Display the &quot;die&lt;<i>r</i>&gt;&quot; image in the die panel.</li>
	<li>If <i>r </i>is 1 (&quot;pig&quot;), set the turn total to 0, and trigger Change 
	Turn Action.</li>
	<li>Otherwise, add r to the turn total. If the current player score plus the 
	turn total is greater than or equal to the goal score of 100, trigger Hold 
	Action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hold Button </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Enable hold button during user turn.</li>
	<li>On hold button press, trigger Hold Action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hold Action</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Display the &quot;hold&quot; image in the die panel.</li>
	<li>Add the turn total to the current player's score.</li>
	<li>Set the turn total to 0.</li>
	<li>If the current player's score is greater than or equal to the goal score 
	of 100, trigger End Game Action.</li>
	<li>Otherwise, trigger Change Turn Action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Change Turn Action</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Change the current player.</li>
	<li>Enable/disable roll and hold buttons if the user/computer is the current 
	player, respectively.</li>
	<li>If it is the computer's turn, begin the Computer Turn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Computer Turn</h3>
<ul>
	<li> <i>Note: In 
	many cases, a separate thread is advisable for the computer player to 
	prevent GUI updates from blocking.</i><li>While the computer is the current player:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Delay for approximately 1 second.</li>
	<li>Compute a hold value of 21 + round((user score - computer score) / 8).</li>
	<li>If either player has 71 points 
or more, or if the turn total is less than the hold value, then trigger Roll 
	Action.&nbsp; Otherwise, trigger Hold Action.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h3>
<img border="0" src="screenshot-popup.png" width="308" height="122" align="right">End Game Action</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Create an display a popup window with: 
	<ul>
		<li>Game over text label - If the user has won, display &quot;You win &lt;user 
		score&gt; to &lt;computer score&gt;.&nbsp; Would you like to play again?&quot; If the 
		computer has won, display &quot;I win &lt;computer score&gt; to &lt;user score&gt;. Would 
		you like to play again?&quot;.</li>
		<li>&quot;New Game&quot; button</li>
		<li>&quot;Quit&quot; button</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When the &quot;New Game&quot; button or &quot;Quit&quot; button is pressed, the 
	popup window 
	closes.</li>
	<li>If the &quot;New Game&quot; button is pressed:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Set both scores and the turn total to 0.</li>
	<li>Change the starting player.</li>
	<li>If the current player is different than the starting player, trigger the 
	Change Turn Action.</li>
	<li>If it is the computer's turn, begin the Computer Turn.&nbsp; Otherwise, 
	display the &quot;roll&quot; image in the die panel.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>If the &quot;Quit&quot; button is pressed, the application terminates, closing the 
	main application frame. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><b>Extra Exercises:</b></p>
<p>1. Use an alternative computer play policy.&nbsp; Let <i>i </i>be the player's score,<i> j</i> 
be the opponent's score, and <i>k</i> be the current turn total.<i>&nbsp; </i>
Some alternative play policies:</p>
<ul>
	<li><u>Hold at 25 or goal</u> - Hold at the lesser of 25 and 100 - i.</li>
	<li><u>4 Scoring Turns</u> - Let <i>t</i> be the number of turns in which a 
	player has held so far.&nbsp; Hold at floor((100 - i)/(4 - t)).</li>
	<li><u>Score Base, Keep Pace, and End Race</u> - If <i>i</i> &gt;= 69 or <i>j</i> 
	&gt;= 69, roll for the goal.&nbsp; Otherwise, hold at the greater of 19 and <i>
	j</i> - 14.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Compute win statistics (e.g. games won, games lost, percentage won) and 
display these at game end.</p>
<p>3. Extend design to three or more user/computer players.</p>
<p>4. (Advanced Project) Extend design to three or more user/computer players 
over a network, using a client-server model.&nbsp; </p>
