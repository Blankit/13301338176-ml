<h2>Thoughts on Early Computer Science Education</h2>
<p>My own introduction to Computer Science (CS) came in the third grade 
(1979-1980) when our school superintendent acquired and allowed student access 
to a Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I microcomputer.&nbsp; Lacking curriculum 
and faculty expertise, students were given access, time, and models of simple 
game programs.&nbsp; These were then supplemented with hobbyist publications 
acquired by students.&nbsp; Learning was through <i>example</i> and <i>play</i>.&nbsp; 
Playful, creative development was both great fun and deeply educational.&nbsp; 
Good programmatic examples provided both the syntactic building blocks and 
algorithmic idioms for such development.</p>
<p>At first, game program listings in hobbyist magazines and books provided 
entertainment.&nbsp; One typed in a program and played with it.&nbsp; However, 
this entertainment came with many hooks for learning.&nbsp; As one entered a 
program, could one anticipate its behavior?&nbsp; Why did the program work?&nbsp; 
When it <i>didn't</i> work, how could the error be identified?&nbsp; Most often, 
this need for troubleshooting created great intrinsic motivation to understand 
the program and gain mastery of the basic idioms of programming.&nbsp; There 
were no assignments.&nbsp; I picked the coolest looking game, entered hundreds 
of lines of code, and invariably learned much from the entire exercise of 
observing the code as it was entered, troubleshooting it when there were errors 
in my entry or the code itself, and experimenting with creative modifications of 
the code.&nbsp; Many people learn well from good examples coupled with high 
intrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>What began as simple game and animation programming took on greater 
significance across my own curriculum.&nbsp; In fifth grade Mathematics, I was 
given time in math class to develop drilling software for ratio problems.&nbsp; 
In sixth grade Social Studies, I escaped a loathsome diorama project and was 
allowed the alternative exercise of creating a program to draw a
<a href="http://www.hunkler.com/pyramids/pyramid_tour.html">cross section of the 
Great Pyramid</a>.&nbsp; In eighth grade, as an extracurricular nonlinear 
writing exercise, I created text adventures, i.e.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction">interactive fiction</a>. 
In high school Physics, I computed orbital elements from observations.&nbsp; The 
cross-curricular possibilities are very exciting when children gain early 
exposure.</p>
<p>In retrospect, computer science and mathematics should be taught hand in 
hand.&nbsp; Some computer scientists could well be described as <i>
mathematicians with power tools</i>.&nbsp; Alongside a standard mathematics 
curriculum a programming language can first serve as a calculator to check work 
and perform complex calculations.&nbsp; Many have observed that teaching a 
concept is one way to attain deeper learning.&nbsp; Aristotle noted that 
&quot;Teaching is the highest form of understanding&quot;.&nbsp; Having a student program 
a computer to work through a mathematical algorithm constitutes a type of 
teaching.&nbsp; A student that correctly &quot;teaches&quot; a computer how to transform a 
mathematical expression understands the transformation intimately in all cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Even more exciting is the possibility of students generating or processing 
empirical data to gain deeper understanding of many topics without tedium.&nbsp; 
With early exposure to programming constructs, beginning probability students 
can easily create dice-rolling simulations.&nbsp; Again, the possibilities are 
very exciting.</p>
<p>Ideally, students should first be exposed to programming as logical 
facilities reach sufficient development for simple logical reasoning.&nbsp; By 
fifth grade, according to 
<a href="http://www.welltrainedmind.com/classical-education/">Classical Education theory</a>, students think more analytically, are more 
interested in asking &quot;Why?&quot;, pay attention to cause and effect, and are capable 
of more analytic thought.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Exposure should begin in a gentle, user-friendly, high-level programming 
language that features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>an interpreter (read, evaluate, print loop) to directly experiment with 
	the language and observe step-by-step execution, </li>
	<li>a very simple development environment to allow development of more 
	complex, persistent development, and</li>
	<li>a Turtle Graphics environment for simple, fun line drawing exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happily, the free <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python programming 
language</a> meets all of these requirements.&nbsp; See below for more details.&nbsp;

<h2>Starting out with Python</h2>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Download and install <a href="http://www.python.org/">
Python</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Start the IDLE application.&nbsp; You will be presented 
with an <i>interpreter</i> window labeled &quot;Python Shell&quot; that can be used most 
primitively as a calculator.&nbsp; At the <i>prompt</i> &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;, the user may enter one 
or more lines as an expression or command statement.&nbsp; The results of the 
computation is printed/displayed, and the user is then presented another prompt.&nbsp; 
This is sometimes referred to as a read-evaluate-print loop.&nbsp; Try entering 
the following math expressions, one per prompt:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">1 + 2</font></li>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">2 + (3 * 4)</font></li>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">10 / 3</font></li>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">10 % 3</font></li>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">10.0 / 3</font></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Times New Roman">The result should look like 
this:</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 2<br>
3<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + (3 * 4)<br>
14<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 / 3<br>
3<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 % 3<br>
1<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10.0 / 3<br>
3.3333333333333335</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">In the case of the third expression, two integers are 
divided and the remainder is thrown away.&nbsp; The modulus operator &quot;<font face="Courier New">%</font>&quot;, 
used in the fourth expression, provides the remainder.&nbsp; A<i> floating point</i> 
number has a decimal point.&nbsp; The fifth expression shows two things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoPlainText">Floating-point numbers result in floating-point 
	division.</li>
	<li>
	<p class="MsoPlainText">Floating-point division is not exact.&nbsp; (This is 
	true for any calculator or computer, although some hide this fact better.)</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Of course, many more mathematical operations are 
available in <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-math.html">Python's math 
module</a>.&nbsp; Each function or constant can be used by preceding it with 
&quot;math.&quot; (e.g. math.sin, math.pi).&nbsp; Alternately, all of these definitions 
can be <i>imported</i> and more easily used without this prefix as shown here:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;&gt; from math import *<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; sin(pi/2)<br>
1.0<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; log(e)<br>
1.0<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; sqrt(2)<br>
1.4142135623730951<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; pow(3, 2)<br>
9.0<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; degrees(pi)<br>
180.0<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; radians(45)<br>
0.78539816339744828</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Playing with <i>turtle graphics</i> is simple and fun. 
First, we import <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-turtle.html">Python's turtle module</a>:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;&gt; from turtle import *</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Now imagine that you are a turtle holding a black pen on 
a piece of white paper.&nbsp; To make a line 100 units (pixels) long, the turtle 
moves the pen forward:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;&gt; forward(100)</font><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">
<img border="0" src="index.1.jpg"></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">(Your window size may vary.)</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">The turtle starts at the center of the window (pixel (0, 
0)) headed to the right (0 degrees).&nbsp; (Note: Python's math uses radians, 
but Python's turtle uses degrees.)&nbsp; To turn the turtle left 120 degrees:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;&gt; left(120)</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">
<img border="0" src="index.2.jpg"></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Repeating these two steps and going forward a third time 
completes a triangle:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;&gt; forward(100)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; left(120)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; forward(100)</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">
<img border="0" src="index.3.jpg"></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">To move the turtle without draw, we can lift the pen up:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;&gt; up()</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Now we can turn to the right 60 degrees, go forward 100, 
change the pen color to green, put the pen down, and draw a circle with radius 
50:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;&gt; right(60)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; forward(100)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; color(&quot;green&quot;)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; down()<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; circle(50)</font><br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="index.4.jpg"></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">If we were making a complex drawing, we would want to 
save our work to be able to draw the same picture again.&nbsp; Also, by saving 
our commands, we can fix our mistakes easily without retyping the parts that are 
correct.&nbsp; To create a file, click &quot;File&quot; on the top menu bar of the Turtle 
Shell, and select &quot;New Window&quot;.&nbsp; (You can also type Control-N.)&nbsp; Now 
copy the text below and paste it in the &quot;Untitled&quot; empty new window:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">from turtle import *<br>
<br>
# black triangle<br>
forward(100)<br>
left(120)<br>
forward(100)<br>
left(120)<br>
forward(100)<br>
<br>
up()<br>
right(60)<br>
forward(100)<br>
<br>
# green circle<br>
color(&quot;green&quot;)<br>
down()<br>
circle(50)</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">There are two things to notice.&nbsp; First, you will 
notice that different parts of your program are different colors.&nbsp; This is 
called <i>syntax highlighting </i>and makes the structure of your program easier 
to read.&nbsp; Second, you will notice that the title of the window is now 
surrounded by asterisks (&quot;*Untitled*&quot;), meaning there are unsaved changed.&nbsp; 
In the &quot;*Untitled*&quot; window, select &quot;File&quot; and &quot;Save&quot; (or just press Control-S) 
and save the file as &quot;turtle_example.py&quot;.&nbsp; (Most Python program filenames 
end in &quot;.py&quot;.)&nbsp; The new window should look something like this:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">
<img border="0" src="index.5.jpg"></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">The red lines are <i>comments</i> and are ignored by 
Python.&nbsp; In fact, from a &quot;<font face="Courier New">#</font>&quot; to the end of the line is ignored by Python on 
any line.&nbsp; Comments are useful to express facts about the program to other 
programmers (or to remind yourself after time has passed).&nbsp; A good 
programmer writes to two audiences.&nbsp; Your first audience is the computer 
which cares only that the program is valid.&nbsp; (You care not only that it is 
valid but also that it does what you intend!)&nbsp; Your second audience is 
people who wish to understand your program, perhaps to use it, correct it, add 
to it, or learn from it.&nbsp; Communicating well to both audiences is an art.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">To run this program, select &quot;Run&quot; and &quot;Run Module&quot; (or 
just press F5).&nbsp; You should see the same black triangle and green circle as 
before.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Now we can add onto our program and make it more 
complex.&nbsp; There are many things we can do in Python, and a
<a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/">tutorial</a> or book (e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1887902996?ie=UTF8&tag=towneho-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1887902996">Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=towneho-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1887902996" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />).&nbsp; 
Here we'll get just a tiny taste of Python programming to hint at possibilities.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Suppose we want to make many squares of size 25.&nbsp; 
It would be wearisome to go forward 25 and left 90 four times in succession each 
time you want to draw a square.&nbsp; Instead we can <i>define</i> a <i>function</i>
<font face="Courier New">square</font> that will do that for us.&nbsp; Copy and 
paste this definition of the <font face="Courier New">square</font> function to 
your program:</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">def square():<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forward(25)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left(90)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forward(25)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left(90)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forward(25)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left(90)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forward(25)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left(90)</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Note: Each line after the first &quot;<font face="Courier New">def</font>&quot; 
line must be indented the same (with spaces or tabs) to be a valid Python 
program.&nbsp; If you're entering this in the Python Shell, a blank line will 
let the interpreter know that the definition is ended.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Here is an example use of our new square function.&nbsp; 
Add this code to the previous, save it, and run it.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">up()<br>
right(90)<br>
forward(100)<br>
color(&quot;blue&quot;)<br>
down()<br>
square()</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><img border="0" src="index.6.jpg"></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Our last goal for now is to quickly draw 60 blue squares 
in a circle.&nbsp; That's a lot of repetition!&nbsp; Fortunately, there is an 
easy way to program repetition.&nbsp; To do something 60 times, one can simply 
type &quot;<font face="Courier New">for i in range(60):</font>&quot; and indent what is to 
be repeated on the lines that follow.&nbsp; For example, here we go forward 3, 
turn right 6, and draw a square.&nbsp; This is repeated 60 times.&nbsp; Try it 
out!&nbsp; (This time, I'm not going to show the result.&nbsp; You'll see it for 
yourself.)</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New">speed(&quot;fastest&quot;)<br>
for i in range(60):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forward(3)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right(6)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; square()</font><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">In this <i>loop</i>, the <i>variable</i> i counts from 0 
to 59.&nbsp; The loop stops repeating the indented commands when it reaches the 
value 60.&nbsp; There are other types of loops, types of data, ways to make 
decisions in a program, and many other interesting patterns for problem solving.&nbsp; 
As I said, this is just a tiny taste.</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Now think of a drawing you would enjoy and challenge 
yourself to make the turtle draw it.&nbsp; As you progress, explore other things 
that <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-turtle.html">Python's turtle module</a> 
can do.&nbsp; Then you can learn new things about Python in general from the
<a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/">Python tutorial</a> or a Computer Science 
introduction that uses Python (e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1887902996?ie=UTF8&tag=towneho-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1887902996">Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=towneho-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1887902996" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />).&nbsp; 
Enjoy!</p>
