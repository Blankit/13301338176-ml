<h2>
<b>Design Project: Interactive Fiction</b></h2>
<p>In this project, you will design a simplified <i>interactive fiction
system</i>.</p>
<h3><b>What is Interactive Fiction?</b> </h3>
<p>Interactive fiction (formerly known as text adventures; similar to multi-user
dungeons/domains (MUDs)) is a form of entertainment in which a user interacts
with and learns about virtual world, usually to achieve a goal.&nbsp; We
will restrict our attention to the genre formerly known as text adventures
where all interaction with the world is through a text-based interface.&nbsp;
Browse the following links for a quick introduction to the world of interactive
fiction:

<h3>
<b>Specification:</b> </h3>
<p>Your interactive fiction system will feature at least six (eventually)
reachable locations, two obstacles (objects which prevent some action,
including movement), two items which, when used with the obstacles (or other 
objects), will
allow the player to overcome the obstacles, a goal (explicit or implicit), and
an indication when that goal has been reached.&nbsp; Your interactive fiction
system should behave similar to the ones featured above, in that:
<ul>
<li>
the game is turn-based,</li>

<li>
each turn, the user's environment is described (preferably a brief description
unless the user has just arrived for the first time or typed "look" as
a command),</li>

<li>
the user can enter simple case-insensitive commands including the minimal
subset below:</li>

<ul>
<li>
(i)nventory (allowed abbreviation in parentheses)</li>

<li>
(n)orth, (s)outh, (e)ast, (w)est, (u)p, (d)own (optionally preceded by
the word "go")</li>

<li>
look - describe environment</li>

<li>
examine &lt;object> - give detailed description of an object</li>

<li>
get &lt;object></li>

<li>
drop &lt;object></li>

<li>
use &lt;object> with &lt;object></li>

<li>
restart</li>

<li>
quit</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>
<b>Goals:</b> </h3>
<ul>

<li>
A <b>complete working  implementation</b> with a <b>text file demo.txt</b>
which has commands which can be fed to standard input to demonstrate your
IF system.</li>

<li>
Support of <b>command line option -e</b> (for echo) which causes your program
to print the command the user just entered.&nbsp; This is particularly
useful for making sense of transcripts when the input source is a file:
<tt>cat
test.txt | java ____ -e > transcript.txt; more transcript.txt</tt></li>

<br>This previous command feeds the contents of the file to your java program
which echoes the input you can't see otherwise.&nbsp; The output of your
program is redirected to an output file transcript.txt.&nbsp; This is then
paged through using the more command.

</ul>
