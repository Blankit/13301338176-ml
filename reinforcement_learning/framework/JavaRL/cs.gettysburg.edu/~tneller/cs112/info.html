<h3>
Course Overview</h3>
In Introduction to Computer Science I, one learns the basic building blocks
for problem-solving using the Java programming language.&nbsp; Introduction
to Computer Science II continues problem-solving development with group work, 
deeper coverage of object-oriented programming topics, exception handling, 
graphical user interfaces, the Java event model, file I/O, and other advanced 
programming topics.&nbsp; We also begin coverage of basic data structures (e.g. collections, linked lists)
and algorithms (e.g. sorting, searching).&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus we
transition to the Data Structures course where one learns a collection of 
common, important tools for problem solving that find application in many diverse
problems computer scientists face.
<h3>
Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Refresh and reinforce Computer Science I problem solving skills.</li>
	<li>Grow group work skills through pair programming.</li>
	<li>Experientially learn more advanced programming topics.</li>
	<li>Prepare for future&nbsp;Data Structures study through a final design 
	project that requires the development of a data structure.</li>
</ul>

Office Hours: Mo-Fr 2-4PM or by appointment. (I finish teach at 2PM on MWF, so 
office hours will start when I arrive back at my office.) Note:&nbsp;Generally,
feel free to drop in if my office door is open (i.e., most of the time
beyond class).<br>Phone: 337-6643

<h3>Student Assistants</h3>
<p>In-class Assistant: TBD, office hours: TBD, 7-9PM, Glatfetler 
207</p>
<p>Grading: TBD, office hours: TBD, 7-9PM, Glatfetler 207<br></p>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>60% Assignments<br>15% Fourth Hour Project <br>
  15% Exam(s)<br>
5% Colloquium Attendance<br>
5% Class Attendance / Participation</p>
<p>You are responsible to know the material 
from each lecture and reading assignment before the start of the next class.&nbsp; 
Homework is due <b>at the beginning of lecture on the due date.</b>&nbsp; Late 
homework will not necessarily be accepted.<b>&nbsp; Source code that does not 
compile may not receive partial credit.</b>&nbsp; (It need not be free from logic 
errors.)&nbsp; You are required to <strong>attend 3 colloquia</strong> or approved departmental 
events over the course of the semester.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Class attendance and participation is required.&nbsp; If you attend all 
classes and are willing to participate, you'll get 100% for this part of your 
grade.&nbsp; Even if you know enough to give a particular lecture, please consider 
the value of helping your peers during in-class exercises.</p>
<p>Woody Allen is quoted as saying
<a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/06/10/showing-up/">&quot;80% of success is 
just showing up.&quot;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; While our class attendance/participation grade 
is not 80% of the final grade, it is critical that late arrivals and unexcused 
absences are not excessive.&nbsp; Missing more than half of class unexcused is 
considered being absent.&nbsp; An unexcused late arrival is counted as a half 
absence.&nbsp; <strong>If the total number of absences counted this way exceeds 
20% of class meetings, i.e. 8.5 absences or more, the student will have failed 
the course.</strong></p>
<h3>
Honor Code</h3>
Honesty, Integrity, Honor.&nbsp; These are more important than anything
we will teach in this class.&nbsp; Students can and are encouraged to help
each other understand course concepts, but all graded work must be done
independently unless otherwise specified (e.g. group work).&nbsp; Submitted work 
should be created by those submitting it.&nbsp; Submission 
of plagiarized code or design work is a violation of the Honor Code, which I 
strictly enforce.&nbsp; For
detailed information about the Honor Code, see
<a href="http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot">
http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/offices/provost/advising/honor_code/index.dot</a>.
<p>What is permitted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Discussing algorithms, syntax, and problem specifications with other 
	students</li>
	<li>Seeking assistance (as needed) from CS professors, students assistants, 
	and approved tutors</li>
	<li>Use of &quot;starter code&quot; supplied by your professor, or code you have 
	previously developed</li>
</ul>
<p>What is not permitted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sharing code: Verbal dictation of code, transference of code (e.g. 
	e-mail, file transfer, entry of printed output, etc.).&nbsp; An important 
	component of this experiential learning process is developing the ability to 
	independently devise algorithms and express them in program code.</li>
	<li>Viewing and/or using unauthorized code (e.g. solutions found online, 
	downloads from code repositories, etc.)</li>
	<li>Submitting work that implicitly takes credit for work that should be 
	credited to others</li>
	<li>Efforts to obscure the source of unauthorized work</li>
	<li>Outsourcing work</li>
</ul>
<p>Put simply, students may discuss assignments at an abstract level (e.g. 
specifications, algorithm pseudocode), but must actually implement solutions 
independently or in permitted groups.&nbsp; Credit should be given where credit 
is due.&nbsp; Let your conscience be your guide.&nbsp; Do not merely focus on 
the result; learn from the process.</p>
