<div align="center"><h3>Nervana</h3></div>
Intel purchased Nervana Systems who was developing both a GPU/software approach in addition to their Nervana Engine ASIC. Comparable performance is unclear. Intel is also planning in integrating into the Phi platform via a [Knights Crest](https://www.nextplatform.com/2016/11/22/inside-intels-strategy-integrate-nervana-deep-learning-assets/) project. [NextPlatform](https://www.nextplatform.com/2016/08/08/deep-learning-chip-upstart-set-take-gpus-task/) suggested the 2017 target on 28nm may be 55 TOPS/s for some width of OP. There is a NervanaCon Intel has scheduled for December, so perhaps we'll see the first fruits then.

> As our Intel CEO Brian Krzanich discussed earlier today at Wall Street Journal’s D.Live event, Intel will soon be shipping the world’s first family of processors designed from the ground up for artificial intelligence (AI): the [Intel® Nervana™ Neural Network Processor family](https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-pioneers-new-technologies-advance-artificial-intelligence/) (formerly known as “Lake Crest”). This family of processors is over 3 years in the making, and on behalf of the team building it, I’d like to share a bit more insight on the motivation and design behind the world’s first neural network processor.

To meet power consumption and performance targets, EyeQ® SoCs are designed in most advanced VLSI process technology nodes – down to 7nm FinFET in the 5th generation.

THE VISION PROCESSING UNIT INCORPORATES PARALLELISM, INSTRUCTION SET ARCHITECTURE, AND MICROARCHITECTURAL FEATURES TO PROVIDE HIGHLY SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE EFFICIENCY ACROSS A RANGE OF COMPUTATIONAL IMAGING AND COMPUTER VISION APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH LOW LATENCY REQUIREMENTS ON THE ORDER OF MILLISECONDS.

[Myriad™ X](https://www.movidius.com/myriadx) is the first VPU to feature the Neural Compute Engine - a dedicated hardware accelerator for running on-device deep neural network applications. Interfacing directly with other key components via the intelligent memory fabric, the Neural Compute Engine is able to deliver industry leading performance per Watt without encountering common data flow bottlenecks encountered by other architectures.

Intel's Loihi test chip is the [First-of-Its-Kind Self-Learning Chip](https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intels-new-self-learning-chip-promises-accelerate-artificial-intelligence/).
> The Loihi research test chip includes digital circuits that mimic the brain’s basic mechanics, making machine learning faster and more efficient while requiring lower compute power. Neuromorphic chip models draw inspiration from how neurons communicate and learn, using spikes and plastic synapses that can be modulated based on timing. This could help computers self-organize and make decisions based on patterns and associations.

> Qualcomm has been fussing around ML for a while with the Zeroth SDK and [Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine](https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/snapdragon-neural-processing-engine). The NPE certainly works reasonably well on the [Hexagon DSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Hexagon) that Qualcomm use. 
> The [Hexagon DSP](https://www.bdti.com/InsideDSP/2015/09/30/Qualcomm) is far from a very wide parallel platform and it has been confirmed by Yann LeCun that Qualcomm and Facebook are working together on a better way in Wired's "[The Race To Build An AI Chip For Everything Just Got Real](https://www.wired.com/2017/04/race-make-ai-chips-everything-heating-fast/)",
> "And more recently, Qualcomm has started building chips specifically for executing neural networks, according to LeCun, who is familiar with Qualcomm's plans because Facebook is helping the chip maker develop technologies related to machine learning. Qualcomm vice president of technology Jeff Gehlhaar confirms the project. "We're very far along in our prototyping and development," he says."
Perhaps we'll see something soon beyond the Kryo CPU, Adreno GPU, Hexagon DSP, and Hexagon Vector Extensions. It is going to be hard to be a start-up in this space if you're competing against Qualcomm's machine learning.

<div align="center"><h3>NVDLA</h3></div>
Nvidia anouced "XAVIER DLA NOW OPEN SOURCE" on GTC2017. We did not see Early Access verion yet. Hopefully, the general release will be avaliable on Sep. as promised. For more analysis, you may want to read [从Nvidia开源深度学习加速器说起](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/XEb5xNeSV_oPs08kDgQg8Q).

<br> Now the open source DLA is available on [Github](https://github.com/nvdla/) and more information can be found [here](http://nvdla.org/).
> The NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA) is a free and open architecture that promotes a standard way to design deep learning inference accelerators. With its modular architecture, NVDLA is scalable, highly configurable, and designed to simplify integration and portability. The hardware supports a wide range of IoT devices. Delivered as an open source project under the NVIDIA Open NVDLA License, all of the software, hardware, and documentation will be available on GitHub. Contributions are welcome.

The soon to be released [AMD Radeon Instinct MI25](https://instinct.radeon.com/en-us/product/mi/radeon-instinct-mi25/) is promising 12.3 TFlops of SP or 24.6 TFlops of FP16. If your calculations are amenable to Nvidia's Tensors, then AMD can't compete. Nvidia also does twice the bandwidth with 900GB/s versus AMD's 484 GB/s.

> AMD has put [a very good X86 server processor](https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/08/08/shape-amd-hpc-ai-iron-come/) into the market for the first time in nine years, and it also has a matching GPU that gives its OEM and ODM partners a credible alternative for HPC and AI workload to the combination of Intel Xeons and Nvidia Teslas that dominate hybrid computing these days.

[TrueNorth](http://www.research.ibm.com/articles/brain-chip.shtml) is IBM's Neuromorphic CMOS ASIC developed in conjunction with the DARPA [SyNAPSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyNAPSE) program.
> It is a manycore processor network on a chip design, with 4096 cores, each one simulating 256 programmable silicon "neurons" for a total of just over a million neurons. In turn, each neuron has 256 programmable "synapses" that convey the signals between them. Hence, the total number of programmable synapses is just over 268 million (228). In terms of basic building blocks, its transistor count is 5.4 billion. Since memory, computation, and communication are handled in each of the 4096 neurosynaptic cores, TrueNorth circumvents the von-Neumann-architecture bottlenecks and is very energy-efficient, consuming 70 milliwatts, about 1/10,000th the power density of conventional microprocessors.

Google's original [TPU](https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/04/05/first-depth-look-googles-tpu-architecture/) had a big lead over GPUs and helped power DeepMind's AlphaGo victory over Lee Sedol in a Go tournament. The original 700MHz TPU is described as having 95 TFlops for 8-bit calculations or 23 TFlops for 16-bit whilst drawing only 40W. This was much faster than GPUs on release but is now slower than Nvidia's V100, but not on a per W basis. The new [TPU2](https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/05/22/hood-googles-tpu2-machine-learning-clusters/) is referred to as a TPU device with four chips and can do around 180 TFlops. Each chip's performance has been doubled to 45 TFlops for 16-bits. You can see the gap to Nvidia's V100 is closing. You can't buy a TPU or TPU2. Google is making them available for use in their [cloud](https://www.blog.google/topics/google-cloud/google-cloud-offer-tpus-machine-learning/) with TPU pods containing 64 devices for up to 11.5 PetaFlops of performance.
