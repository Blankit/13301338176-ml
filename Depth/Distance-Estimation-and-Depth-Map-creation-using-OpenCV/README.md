# Distance-Estimation-and-Depth-Map-creation-using-OpenCV
In this day and age, when google cars and teslaâ€™s autopilot features are becoming more  mainstream, combined with the huge advances in machine learning and computer vision. It has become more important for us to understand and learn the fundamental and basic steps of  computer vision.   The purpose of this project is to identify a method of image processing that can then be used to  develop a software tool. The tool itself will be used to work out the distance that certain  objects are away from it using stereo vision. This tool will also allow the user to calibrate the  cameras and take both pictures and videos. The hardware used in this project will be low-end  but the steps and methods used should be easily transferable and usable with most equipment.
